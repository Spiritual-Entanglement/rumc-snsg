### Invitatory

In many official prayer books from several denominations, the daily prayers always start with a specific set of prayers that serve to prepare us spiritually for the rest of the day and the prayers and devotions that follow.

A common theme is found in prayer books from denominations that have a more liturgical focus than non-denominational churches.  This theme is hundreds of years old.  In my experiments with many prayer books, I have found this the most helpful for my prayer time.

While Pastor Augie is going through the current sermon series on the Lord's Prayer, he asked us to say the Lord's Prayer at least once per day.  I would challenge all of us to do something even harder, and therefore even more rewarding by starting our prayer time in the morning with the following.  After the sermon series, maybe keep this habit of prayer before you normal prayers and devotions, but modify it to suit your own needs.  Until then, please try to pray it as written below.

#### Pray these opening sentences
- Lord, open my lips
    and my mouth will declare Your praise.
- God come to my assistance,
    Lord, make haste to help me as I pray.


#### Pray Psalm 95:1-7
Come, let us sing to the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and shout with joy to the Rock who saves us.
Let us approach him with praise and thanksgiving and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sing joyful songs to the Lord
The Lord is God, the mighty God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the great king over all the gods.
He holds in his hands the depths of the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and the highest mountains as well.
He made the sea; it belongs to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the dry land, too, for it was formed by his hands.
Come, then, let us bow down and worship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  bending the knee before the Lord, our maker,
For he is our God and we are his people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the flock he shepherds.
Today, listen to the voice of the Lord

#### Now pray The Lord's Prayer
Our Father...

#### Now the Gloria Patri
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and ever shall be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  world without end. Amen.
