**The Invitatory**
In many official prayer books from several denominations, the daily prayers always start with a specific set of prayers that serve to prepare us spiritually for the rest of the day and the prayers and devotions that follow.  A common theme is found in prayer books from denominations that have a more liturgical focus than non-denominational churches.  This theme is hundreds of years old.  In my experiments with many prayer books, I have found this the most helpful for my prayer time. Try this for 30 days, and then modify it to fit your own needs.

**Pray this opening**
Lord, open my lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my mouth will declare Your praise.
God come to my assistance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, make haste to help me (as I pray).

**Pray Psalm 95**

|**Psalm 95**||
|---|---|
|Come, let us sing to the Lord<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and shout with joy to the Rock who saves us.<br /> Let us approach him with praise and thanksgiving and<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sing joyful songs to the Lord<br /> The Lord is God, the mighty God,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the great king over all the gods.<br /> He holds in his hands the depths of the earth<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and the highest mountains as well.<br /> He made the sea; it belongs to him,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the dry land, too, for it was formed by his hands.<br /> Come, then, let us bow down and worship,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  bending the knee before the Lord, our maker,<br /> For he is our God and we are his people,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the flock he shepherds.| Today, listen to the voice of the Lord:<br /> Do not grow stubborn, as your fathers did<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  in the wilderness,<br /> when at Meriba and Massah<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  they challenged me and provoked me,<br /> Although they had seen all of my works.<br /> <br /> Forty years I endured that generation.<br /> I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and they do not know my ways."<br /> So I swore in my anger,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "They shall not enter into my rest."<br />|

**Now pray The Lord's Prayer**
Our Father...

**Now the Gloria Patri**
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and ever shall be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kingdom without end. Amen.
