### Unit 3 - Interpreting the Mystery - Part 01

Revelation & the End of All Things.
Pages 1 - 8
Questions for chapter 1 are on page 202 if you are interested.

#### Introduction

"The power of a book can be seen in what it does to people..."

This first sentence frames why we need to talk ABOUT the book before we
begin studying its content.

What comes to your mind when you think about the book of Revelation?
- No matter the source: what have you heard about the contents of the book before we started this study?
- Do any emotions come to mind?
- Any images?
- Have you read any books, seen any documentaries, heard any sermons, etc., about Revelation before?
  - What was your reaction to what you read, saw, or heard?

Another important point from page 1,
"A sketch of some of the ways in which Christian have interpreted the book over the centuries can provide a valuable preface to reading Revelation."

Our Beliefs and Interpretations:
- are shaped by what others have told us during our lives.
  - What questions did they ask about Revelation?
  - What assumptions did they make about Revelation?
  - What beliefs and assumptions did they inherit before they began to study the book?
- everything we have heard, read, and seen, shapes our current beliefs and assumptions.

It is good to hear if other have a different point of view, and why.

**Revelation has had many interpretations since the days of the early church.**
- It is a message about events to happen in the coming days.
- It is a message about timeless truths about how God relates to ALL generations throughout time.
- It is a message describing events that have already taken place.

Do you hold any of these views right now?
If so, are you able to explain why you believe that way?


#### Revelation and the Future

- One bit of Revelation that makes people think it is about the future is the millennial kingdom. Rev 20:4

- Justin Martyr (ca 100-165)
  - Smart, philosophically minded.
  - A convert to Christianity from eastern part of the Roman Empire.
  - believed that Jesus fulfilled the OT promises.
  - believed the 1000-year reign points to a future reign of God and the Saints on Earth.
    - as an earthly kingdom or political system.
	- would become a peaceful paradise. Is 65:17-25
  - AFTER the peaceful paradise is established:
    - the last judgement
	- the faithful enter eternity with God
  - Mistake: Isa 65:17-25 refers to the new Heaven and Earth
    - John identifies the new Heaven and Earth with New Jerusalem,
	  - not with the millennial kingdom.

- Irenaeus (ca 130 - 200)
  - from eastern part of the Roman Empire
    - but lived most of his life in Lyon, France
  - Bishop of a persecuted Christian community.
  - Major work, "Against Heresies"
  - History, like creation proceeds in 7 steps:
    - Psalm 90:4 - one day is like a thousand years to God
	- Human history: 6,000 years - 0 thru 6,000
	- Millennial Kingdom: 1,000 years - 6,001 thru 7,000.
  - On Earth
    - the Millennial Kingdom will be on the Earth.
	- restores creation to a condition of perfection.
	- affirms the goodness of God's creation.
	  - Counters the Gnostics heresy.
	    - all material creation is evil and irredeemable.

- Montanus (late second century)
  - new religious movement in Phrygia (cult)
  - claimed to be THE mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit.
  - two women prophets: Priscilla and Maximilla.
    - New Jerusalem would be in Phyrgia.
  - Gaius: opposes Montanus,
    - discredits Revelation because Montanus takes his prophecy from it.
	- claims Revelation was written by heretic Cerinthus.
	- argues Montanus followers want the new kingdom to be on earth so they can indulge their pleasures.

- Victorinus (died 304)
  - Bishop of Pettau (now Slovenia)
  - martyred in Diocletian's persecution of Christians.
  - Wrote the oldest existing commentary on Revelation.
  - Revelation contains disaster that would happen in the course of human history.
    - equates Babylon with Rome
	- the beast includes traits of Nero
	  - still accepted by scholars today.
	- the mellinnial kingdom will be
	  - a earthly, world-wide kingdom
	  - governed by the saints.
  - **IMPORANT Contribution**
    - Events in Revelation will not happen in chronological sequence.
	  - therefore, NOT a step-by-step script of events.
	  - John's visions are sometimes repeditive in nature it not in detail.
      - The same messages are repeated but with in different ways.
	    - Like the OT when Pharoah tells Joseph his two different dreams of bounty and famine.
		- recognized the 7 trumpets and the seven bowls of plagues represent the same series of threats.
		- John twice speaks of the heavens going dark.
		- John twice speaks of the sea turning to blood.
		- Events are described twice but do not happen twice.
	  - Very popular idea with current scholarship.

- Jerome (ca 342-420)
  - "brilliant and prickly biblical scholar"
  - produced the Latin Vulgate
  - preserved and revised Victorinus's commentary.
    - did not necessarily (or completely) agree with Victorinus.
  - **IMPORANT Contribution**
    - in a postscript to Victorinus' commentary.
	  - argued that Revelation **MUST** be understood _spiritually_
	- the millennial kingdom really describes Christian obedience.
	  - Satan is bound when evil is resisted.
	- Many begin to think of Revelation in a timeless fashion.
	  - "a vision of the spiritual battle that Christians in all times and places were to wage against sin."

#### Revelation as Timeless Truth.

- Dionysius (died ca 264)
  - Bishop of Alexandria
  - did **not** like the idea of an earthly millennial kingdom
    - too much chance for bodily indulgence.
  - _Therefore_ some deeper spiritual meaning to the book of Revelation _must_ exist.

- Origen (ca 185-254)
  - Dionysius teacher
  - suggested the idea of a deeper meaning to Revelation's message.
  - leading 3rd century biblical interpreter.
  - no interest in the time and place of the battle of Armageddon.
    - this great conflict represents the triumph of God over good and evil.
	- therefore it is not a earthly battle.`
    - the text identifies the warrior Christian with the Word of God
	  - when Heaven is opened
	  - gives people the light of Truth
	  - victory is won when the knowledge of truth destorys all that is evil and sinful in the soul.

- Tyconius (died ca 400)
  - proposed the millennial kingdom started with the first coming of Christ.
  - the millennial kingdom is a present reality not a future event.
    - supported by two NT scriptures
	  - Rev 20:2 - the kingdom begins when Satan is bound.
	  - Matt 12:29 - Jesus already bound Satan by the exorcisms He performed.
	- Events in the real world were interpretted to support this view.
  - However, the kingdom was not fully realized yet.
    - there is still friction outside and within the church.
	  - in the church the Donatists reject church leadership who handed over scripture to be burned during Diocletian's persecutions.
	- Satan is only bound.
	- Satan is only annihilated at the end of time (Rev 20:7-10)

- Augustine (354 - 430)
  - Theologian from N. Africa.
  - His work has a huge impact on Western thought both secular and Christian.
  - **Opposed** the Donatists,
    - he did incorporate some of Tyconius's ideas.
  - From Tyconius's ideas allow one to read Revelation and apply it to the Christian interior life no matter the time or place.
  - We enter the millennial kingdom at our baptism: the first ressurection.
    - we participate in that with Christ through water baptism.
  - The second ressurection is bodily, at the end of time.
  - Satan is confined to the abyss of the human heart where he remains until God destroys the wickedness there.
  - the 1000 year reign, the millenial kingdom it not an exact period of time, but represents all time in totality.
    - Current time and history come to an end at Jesus Christ's second coming.
    - Therefore, the primary movement (as reflected in Scripture)
	  - is our soul's journey from the earthly "city" to the heavenly "city."

With Augustine's use of Tyconius's interpretation,
and Jerome's edited version of Victorinus's commentary,

the **timeless and spiritual** reading of Revelation becomes the dominant viewpoint for many centuries.
