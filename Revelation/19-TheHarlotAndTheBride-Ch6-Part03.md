Part 3: Pages 159 - 167
- Babylon's Funeral - Rev 18:1-24 - page 159
  - Babylon's Fall - Rev 18:1-8 - page 160
  - The Mourners - Rev 18:9-24 - page 162
- Hallelujah, The Lord Reigns - Rev 19:1-10 - page 165

## Start Here:
### The Question: page 165
"Some may wonder whether Revelation opposes all that human culture has produced, since one could read the text as a thoroughgoing rejection of political institutions, trade, craftsmanship, musical achievements, and wedding celebrations."

### The Answer: page 165
"...this interpretation would miss the point....John confronts the seamy side of... (culture) ...that is degrading and destructive."
- Revelation 18 will talk about many neutral things as if they are evil.
  - I think this is where many of the strict "RULES" of Christianity came from for very conservative, strict denominations:
    - don't play cards, drink ANY alcohol, go to dances or movies, etc., etc.
  - It is not the things or activities themselves that are evil...
    - It is the motive and result for which they are pursued and used.
- The use of things in culture that get twisted in a way that destroys a person's life.  Their:
  - health
  - relationships with their spouse, family, and friends
  - things that abuse or hurt others.
  - things that only cater only to selfish indulgence, pride, and passions.
  - addictive and unchecked impulsive behavior.
- All of these things destroy a spiritual, heart-centered relationship with God.
  - and lead to various forms of idolatry.
    - worshiping something that is not God as if it were God.
    - pushing God aside in pursuit of instant, short-lived rewards and gratifications.
### The Point #1
page 160: "...to move readers to renounce the arrogant and inhumane ways of injustice.  The key verse is 18:4:
> Come out of her, my people,
> so that you do not take part in her sins,
> and so that you do not share in her plagues."
### The Point #2
page 161: "...to dissociate themselves from the infidelity and materialism..., following instead in the ways of the Lamb."
### The Point #3
page 165: "The Christians in Asia minor were called to resist social currents and institutions that were driven by the seduction of luxury, license, and power,  Readers of later generations are called to do the same, wherever these appear."

## Babylon's Funeral - Rev 18:1-24 - page 159
### Overview
- This vision does *not* in sequence. Page 159
  - Rev 18:2 Babylon has already fallen.
  - Rev 18:4 People urged to leave Babylon, so it cannot have fallen yet.
  - Rev 18:9 "the grief of the Kings in the future tense."
  - Rev 18:11 "the grief of the merchants in the present tense."
  - Rev 18:18 "the grief of the shipmasters in the past tense."
  - Rev 18:21 the angel of with the millstone speaks in future tense.
- "John recounts a past vision of a future occurrence..."
  - "...his primary concern..." is "...to influence the way his readers live in the present, startling them into considering their current commitments in relationship to the ways of God (A. Yarbro Collins, *Apocalypse*, 126)."
- Our author parallels *A Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens.
  - The vision of Christmas *after* Ebenezer dies, show people who are not concerned or kind about the memory of him. (So many Psalms echo these things)
    - people are more concerned about how his property is divided
    - and the poor rejoicing that their creditor has died.
    - his grave is overgrown and forgotten.
    - Scrooge: "Why show me this, if I am past all hope?!  Assure me that I may yet change...by an altered life."
  - Scrooge was warned and given time to repent.
  - The harlot is "wealthy, grasping, and callous."
    - We are taken to the destroyed Babylon in rubble.
      - Demon like creatures and carrion birds are the only inhabitants now (we can imagine what they are feeding on).
    - Next we hear political, business, and cultural leaders mourn the loss of the great city.
      - Obviously, they are mostly concerned with the impact to their power, wealth, and leisure.
    - The poor and oppressed, many already in Heaven, do have cause to rejoice.
- "The proper response to the vision is *not* fatalism, but "an altered life" (Scrooge)."
  - Christians! "...become aware of your complicity in the practices of the empire..."
    - distance yourselves from its ways.
      - the oppressive, abusive, unjust, idolatrous, and indulgent ways that cause harm to others and your relationship with God.

### Babylon's Fall - Rev 18:1-8

- Rev 18:1 An angel descends from Heaven.
  - He has an appearance the broadcasts his authority given to him by God.
  - He lights up the entire world with his brilliance.
  - This angel declares Babylon's fall echoing prophets.
    - Two examples:
    > **Isaiah 21:9**: Here they come: charioteers, pairs of horsemen!”
    > One spoke up and said,
    > “Fallen, fallen is Babylon,
    > and all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground!”
    > **Jeremiah 50:34f-40**: But he will unsettle the people of Babylon.
    > 35. A sword against Babylon and its people, declares the LORD, along with its officials and sages.
    > 36. A sword against its diviners so that they become fools. A sword against its warriors so that they are terrified.
    > 37. A sword against its horses and chariots, and the mercenaries in its midst so that they lose courage. A sword against its treasures so that they are looted.
    > 38. A sword against the water supplies so that they dry up. It is truly the land of idols, idols about which they have gone utterly mad!
    > 39. Therefore, Babylon will become a ghost town, a place for desert animals, hyenas, and ravenous birds. No one will live there again; no one will make it their home.
    > 40. Just as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, declares the LORD, so no one will live in Babylon or settle there again.

- Adultery.  ""Fornication" is a metaphor for practices that violated relationships with God and the Lamb.
  - The relationship between Israel and God, between Christians and God, is depicted in the sacredness of a marriage.
  - I think much of this adulterous behavior, means any behaviors that violate the original covenant with Abraham and the nation of Israel as well as the New Covenant with Jesus (the Lamb).
  - "eating meat offered to idols as a form of such fornication.
- Rev 18:4 "Come out of her, my people"
  - This is not necessarily an order to physically leave the city
  - It is a call for the faithful to dissociate themselves from cultural and business practices that harm others and interrupt one's relationship with God.
- Babylon's world is self-centered
  - The Empire/Culture deludes itself into thinking it reigns supreme.
    - It does not need to heed God.
    - But its splendor came at a cost to many poor an oppressed.
  - Rev 18:6 proclaims it will be dealt with in the same manner it built its empire.

### The Mourners - Rev 18:9-24
**Three groups of mourners**
1. Kings - Rev:9-10 - page 162
   - They stand at a safe distance.
   - The sordid relationship is characterized as luxurious and deviantly intimate.
     - It highlights the corruption and selfishness.
   - They are obviously mourning the loss of their selfish desires.
     - The party is over.
   - They lament that the judgement and punishment has come swiftly (Rev 18:10).
     - They have obviously been ignoring any previous warnings God has sent.
2. Merchants - Rev 18:11-17a
   - Another self-interested group mourns the loss of profit from their business. Rev 18:11-14.
     - Many luxury items are listed; items the poor cannot afford.
       - dainties, fine clothing, jewelry.
       - such a waste!  And now our profits are gone!
   - Again they say the punishment came quickly.
     - Another group that has not paid any attention to God's warnings and admonitions to repentance.
   - 2.1. **Slaves** - Human souls.  Mentioned last on the list.
     - "The Greek work is literally "bodies"..." page 163
     - John highlights with this the brutality of slave trade reducing human beings to simple commercial products.
     - A luxury items.
3. Shipping Magnets
   - The third group is everyone with a stake in shipping which has only grown more expansive since John's time.
     - We recently saw the results of interruption to shipping during Covid and when their was a ship stuck in the Suez Canal.
   - page 167 C. Koester describes the mourner's lament as "an exercise in self-pity."
     - page 164, "In weeping for her, they weep for their bank accounts."

**Angel 2**
- Another angel enters and throws a huge mill stone into the sea.
  - It is an example of how quickly and completely Babylon will be destroyed.
  - Rev 18:21
- With that everything will Stop - Rev 18:22-23
  - music, manufacturing, food production, energy production, celebrations of all kinds.
  - Babylon was made great by the business leaders of the world.
    - The whole world was deceived by their tricks, their secret dealings, and greed.

**Shed Blood**
- Rev 18:24 declares that Babylon is built not just on the exploitation of Christians, but even the poor and oppressed who are not believers.
  - This is not just a fact know only to John.
    - Tacitus says in the Annals, 1.10.4, "...peace stained with blood..."
  - Page 164, "The critique of Babylon in Revelation 18 stresses the interconnection between economic affluence, self-deceptive arrogance, and political brutality."

**"Babylon" includes many times and places"**
- At the bottom Page 164, we see how John's characterization of Babylon is made up of many cultures and even extends to our present times and beyond.
  - Tyre: Ezek 26-28
  - Babylon (the actual city), Jer 50-51
  - the city's fall and desolation: Is 13:19-22, 21:9.
  - sins: Jer 51:9, 16:18
  - harlot's boast about never being a widow: Is 47:8.
  - list of trade goods: Ezek 27:12-22.
  - Babylon's destruction depicted by a stone thrown into the sea: Jer 51:63-64
  - End of celebrations, especially those as joyous as weddings and the halt to food and energy production: Jer 25:10
  - More could be added, say our author.

**The Point #3**
- page 165: "The Christians in Asia minor were called to resist social currents and institutions that were driven by the seduction of luxury, license, and power,  Readers of later generations are called to do the same, wherever these appear."

- Revelation offers a contrasting picture to life in Babylon.
  - Music is still played in Heaven for God and for the Lamb: Rev 15:25
  - All the faithful will still celebrate in Heaven at the marriage feast of the Lamb: Rev 19:7, 9.
  - Each cycle ends with joy and worship in Heaven.
    - This is to encourage the faithful to endure and look at God's bigger picture.

## Hallelujah, The Lord Reigns - Rev 19:1-10 - page 165
- The cycle ends at choruses of hallelujah ("praise the Lord") build and multiple.
  - the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fall down in worship.
  - the entire heavenly throng joins.

- Page 166. Rev 19:2-3 seem to be rejoicing in destruction
  - the harlot is destroyed.
  - smoke rises from the ruins of Babylon.
  - Some will view this as very harsh and unchristian to celebrate this.
    - C. Koester offers this argument:
      - Babylon is responsible for much oppression, injustice, and bloodshed.
        - Not just of Christians, but unfaithful as well.
      - Those who have been oppressed now find relief.
      - Rev 2: God's justice being celebrated, not destruction.
        - "Justice is done when evil self-destructs. Babylon's fiery end comes when the demonic power that is uses against others ends up destroying Babylon itself."
  - Psalm 89:14-17 (from The Grail Psalms.  **Not** the ***Revised*** Grail Psalms)
    > 14 Yours is a mighty arm, O Lord; your hand is strong, your right hand ready.
    > 15 Justice and right are the pillars of your throne, love and truth walk in your presence.
    > 16 Happy the people who acclaim such a king, who walk, O Lord, in the light of your face,
    > 17 who find their joy every day in your name, who make your justice the source of their bliss.
    - Other translations don't say Psalm 89:17b it that way.
      > NIV and by your favor you exalt our horn.
      > NRSV by your favor our horn is exalted.
      > KJV And in they favor our horn shall be exalted.
    - Horns have several similar meanings in the Bible.  In this case:
      "To have the horn "exalted" denotes prosperity and triumph ( Psalms 89:17 Psalms 89:24 ). (https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/horn)
    - exaltation:
      > a feeling or state of extreme happiness
      > the action of elevating someone in rank, power, or character.

**The Marriage Feast of the Lamb**
- Rev 19:7, the Bride is ready.
  - The Old Testament likens God's people as His bride.
    - Is 62.5; Jer 2:2; Hos 2:19-20
  - The New Testament likens the Church as His bride.
    - 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:25-32; John 3:29
  - In Rev 21:2, 9 we learn the "bride" is the New Jerusalem.

## Community - Page 166
**"The real question is the nature of the community to which people belong."**
- Both the bride and the harlot of relational images of these communities.
  - Celebration
  - Linen garments
  - Way of Life
- An angel tells John write specifically that all those invited to the marriage supper are blessed.

## Worship GOD - Page 168
- The cycle concludes with a reminder of the real message of Revelation:
  - Worship GOD - Rev 19:10
- John seems to be overwhelmed and falls down to worship the angel that told him to write.
  - The angel immediately rebukes him and declares that he is a fellow servant just like John.
  - Throughout Revelation we have been warned not to worship man, idols, beasts, evil entities, etc.
    - Now we are warned to also be careful about worshiping "angelic emissaries of God."
- the true test of a prophet "is whether it moves people to worship God and to be faithful to Jesus (see pages 48-50)."
  - this can be said of anything:
    - prophecy
    - praying
    - the "style" of music we sing.
    - the "style" of our worship service
