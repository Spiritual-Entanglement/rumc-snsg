#### The beast from the sea. Rev 13: 1- 10

- Satan calls this thing from the sea
  - It's cinematic. We can see it!
    - It's meant to strike fear in us!
    - It's meant to look invincible!
  - The dragon gives the beast its power, position, and authority Rev 13:2.
  - The people worship the beast. Who is like him?
    - Miraculously survives a fatal-looking head wound.
    - It speaks great things and ideas people want to hear.
      - But these things contain blasphemy.
    - As a result, the people also worship the dragon

  - People ask, who can fight against him?
    - He seems so powerful and invincible
      - He's given all power and authority from the dragon.
      - Surely no humans can stand against him
    - But the war has already been won in Heaven
      - The dragon was kicked out by Michael and the Angels.
      - The dragon and his henchmen are confined to operate only on the earth.
      - The dragon defeat came because of the Blood of the Lamb and the testimony of the saints.
  - "The beast is the demonic counterpart of the Lamb." pg 126
    - The Lamb symbolically reveals "something about the saving power of Christ's self-sacrifice."
      - we are attracted to the Lamb
      - Result? "the world worship God the Creator." pg 127
    - The beast reveals "something about the destructive power of evil."
      - Repulsive
      - Result: "the world worships Satan the destroyer." pg 127
    - Contrast: bottom paragraph on pg 126
      - God in Heaven sends the Lamb to suffer and died for others sins.
        - The dragon sends the beast who deceives and kills others before then can repent.
      - The Lamb shares the glory, power, and authority of God, given to Him by God.
        - The beast is given power, position and authority on earth by the dragon
      - In Heaven the Lamb looks "slaughtered," yet is alive. We know where the Lamb's wounds came from.
        - The beast appears with one head that looks like it had a fatal wound but was healed.
      - "The Lamb" conquers "by faithfully enduring death for the sake of others. Rev 5:5-6,12:11.
        - The beast causes the death of others. 13:7
      - The Lamb frees ALL people, to serve God by their own choosing.
        - The beast enslaves to serve the dragon.
      - There is no middle ground,
        - Individuals must choose a side.
        - of course John is calling us to God's side.
  - John combines 4 beasts, or kingdoms, in Daniel 7, into one beast from the sea.
    - The beast is a composite of many evil kingdoms, tyrants, dictators, oppressors over many eras.
      - They are all part of the singular k destructive power of evil.
    - John is using popular culture of the times in the actions of the beast.
      - This becomes clearer in Rev 17:9-10.
      - Many "traits of Rome and its emperors." pg 127
        - Ruling many different "tribes" and "nations."
        - Emperors blasphemed by using the names of God for themselves.

  - John is urging "readers to persevere because God has already claimed them and does not want them to fall away." pg 128f
    - Revelation emphasizes repentance for those already in the church as well as those not in the Church.
      - It is not saving that with every sin your name gets erased from the book
    - You are already in the book therefore endure.  God has already claimed you.
  - Belonging to God does not bring exemption from suffering
    - I think that would negate free will.

      - No, follow God out of freely chosen love.
    - The beast's tactics inflict pain, suffering, and death on others
      - Christians "conquer the beast...by following an alternative course of faithful endurance and resistance to false worship and oppression that has been set by the Lamb. Rev 12:11
