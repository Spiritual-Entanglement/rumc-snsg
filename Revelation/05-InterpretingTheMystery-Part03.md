### Unit 5 - Interpreting the Mystery - Part 03
FROM: Revelation & the End of All Things.
Pages 14 - 44
Questions for chapter 1 are on page 202 if you are interested.

### Introduction

"The power of a book can be seen in what it does to people..."

This first sentence frames why we need to talk ABOUT the book before we begin studying its content.

Another important point from page 1,<br />
"A sketch of some of the ways in which Christian have interpreted the book over the centuries can provide a valuable preface to reading Revelation."

Our Beliefs and Interpretations
- are shaped by what others have told us during our lives.
- everything we have heard, read, and seen, shapes our current beliefs and assumptions.

It is good to hear if other have a different point of view, and why.

**Revelation has had many interpretations since the days of the early church.**
- It is a message about events to happen in the coming days.
- It is a message about timeless truths about how God relates to ALL generations throughout time.
- It is a message describing events that have already taken place.

### Apocalyptic Fever, Disappointment, and Tragedy

Sectarian groups have tried to pinpoint the second coming of Christ.
There is a pattern to these groups:
- A charismatic individual
  - develops a distinctive interpretation of the Bible
  - gathers a group of devoted followers
  - anticipate Christ's second coming in the near future.

Example
- William Miller (1782 - 1849)
  - lay Baptist Preacher
  - intense study of Daniel and Revelation
  - days symbolize years in Ezekiel 4:6
    - 2,300 "days" "until the sanctuary is cleansed"
  - the sanctuary is the whole Earth
  - Christ's second coming cleanses the sanctuary.
    - date expected is in Mar 21 1843 - Mar 21 1844.
	  - followers split when the dates pass w/o the Second Coming
	- also October 22, 1844
	  - The Great Disappointment - followers fracture again.
	- Some believe Christ did return but in spirit only.
	  - not physically....that will come later.

- Ellen White (1827 - 1915
  - gathered William Miller followers
    - who believed the spiritual return of Christ happened in 1844.
  - became the Seventh Day Adventists

- Charles Taze Russell (1852 - 1916)
  - Believed Christ returned in the spirit only, in 1874
  - Bible studies and publishing through Watch Tower Tract Society.
  - WWI created excitement for his followers.
  - His followers become the Jehovah's Witnesses.
    - still believe 1914 was a pivotal year in God's plan.
	- Some believe the 144,000 from Rev 7:4-8 and 14:1-5 were chosen by 1914.

- Branch Dividians
  - Founder: Victor Houteff (died 1955)
    - Seventh-Day Adventist.
	- Felt called to gather the 144,000.
	  - Established the Mt Carmel Center near Waco in 1935.
	  - intended to relocate to Palistine.
	  - His widow predicted that on April 22, 1959, God would move them to Palistine.
	  - When the prediction failed the group factures.
	    - the Branch Dividians take over Mt Carmel Center.
  - Vernon Howell (died 1993)
    - aka: David Koresh
	- became leader of the Branch Dividians.
	- Thinks he is the "Lamb" that breaks the seals on the scroll in Rev 5:22
	- Sees himself as the rider on the white horse in Rev 6:1-22

### Rapture, Tribulation, and Armageddon

Much of modern-day evangelicalism belief begins here.

- John Nelson Darby (1800 - 1882)
  - British writer associated with the Plymouth Brethren
- Cyrus Scofield
  - Published the Scofield Reference Bible with Darby's ideas
    - first published in 1909
- Dispensationalists
  - Summary of belief:
    - the Rapture will cause millions to disappear from Earth.
	  - they are bodily taken from earth straight to Heaven -- no death.
      - Famine, plagues, wars, and natural disasters grow out of hand.
	    - everyone left suffers terribly.
	- The Tribulation
      - The AntiChrist comes to power with a one-World government for 7 years.
	    - these years are even more terrible and chaotic than any in history.
    - Armageddon
      - The 7 year Tribulation ends with the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth.
	    - This Kingdom lasts for 1,000 years.
  - Dispensation
    - History is divided into sequential periods called "dispensations."
	- The last period is the 1,000 year reign of Christ on Earth: The Millennium.
	- PRE-Millennialists
	  - believe the conditions on earth will steadily grow worse until Christ returns and the Millennium begins.
	  - they consider the prophetic verses in the bible constitute history written in advance.
	    - a script that will be played out exactly in order.
		- the trick is to match current events to elements of the script.
  - God stopped the fulfillment of His plan regarding Israel until sometime in the future.
  - The church, mostly of Gentiles is established as God's new people.

- The Script
  - "After the Jews rejected Christ, God stopped the clock of prophecy with just one seven-year period remaining."
  - Many try to line up the first six, 7-year periods with times in the past.
  - The period between the 1st Century and today lies in the gap between Dan 9:26 and Dan 9:27.

  - The Rapture
    - This is the signal that God is starting the last 7 year period.
	  - 1 Thess 4:16-17 (page 20)
	  - Some back this up saying the word "church" does not appear between Rev 3:22 thru 22:16.
  - The AntiChrist forms a one-world government.
  - The number of the Beast: 666
    - economics based system with wild inflation.
  - New Religion is spread globally.
    - the "harlot" evangelizes and attracts the majority to this new religion.
  - Two Witnesses
    - Some people have embraced Christianity.
	- Two witnesses to God rise in prominence. 
	- their message is heard throughout the world.
	- they are martyred and left where they fall for three days.
	- they are raised to life after three days, and many become Christians.
  - Israel will make a pact with the AntiChrist and his government in the beginning.
    - The AntiChrist will double cross them
	- The battle of Armageddon begins with all the armies of the world fighting.
  - The Millennium begins as Armageddon ends.
    - Satan is bound for 1,000 years
	- Peace throughout the world 
  - Satan released for a short time after 1000 years.
    - God defeats and destroys Satan once and for all.

- Why do people believe this?
  - "perceptions that the world is sliding into increasing violence and moral decay.
  - the dispensationalists system assures people that God is ultimately in control and will eventually put a stop to the chaos.
  - assurance that God will put the world right and His purposes WILL Be carried out.
  - another reason
    - it gives us the idea that we can predict and anticipate God's actions.
	- it gives "a framework for interpreting world events."

- Problems with the Script.
  1. It is completely mechanical.
     - the verses in Dan 9:26-27 clearly read and tell about events happening in one time period when read in context.
       - the Darby system has God stopping the clock for 2000 years at verse 26.
       - Not only the wording but the English punctuation is required to make this work. KJV and NIV
       - Other translations do not read this way because the punctuation is different.  NAB, TEV, NRSV.
       - The Bible was not written in English.
     - this is foreign to Revelation
       - Revelation does NOT QUOTE the Old Testament. Only paraphrases the OT.
         - God WILL fulfill His prophecies, but it does not say exactly HOW.
  2. Neither Daniel nor Revelation refers to the rapture.
     - The idea that the people on earth that make up "the" Church disappear when the WORD church disappers from the Revelation narrative, is forced.
  3. The distinction between Israel and the Christian church is also forced.
     - New Testament writers clearly see Israel's story continuing in the Christian church.
	 - The Gentiles in the church are "grafted" onto the tree that is Paul uses as a metphor for Istrael.
	   - Rom 11:13-24
	   - The wall dividing Jew and Gentile is broken down. Eph 2:11-22

- Ongoing Popularity of the Script pg 25
  - Previously the "Harlot" was supposed to be heretical religion centered in Rome.
  - Since WWII much focus has been trying to shift the image of the Harlot away from Rome and on to Middle Eastern factions.
    - Iraq
	- Al-Qaeda: 9/11
	- ISIS
    - Modern example of what the 7 trumpets represent: pg 26
  - However, very few try to pinpoint an actual date now.

### Historical and Literary Study of Revelation
pg 27

- We have addressed this topic before.
  - Again, we remind ourselves of this before we start reading the actual scripture to make ourselves aware of our preconceived ideas, and this allows us to be able to consider other ideas and approaches.
  - this section is from the perspective of the author: Craig Koester.

- Many who take Bible scripture literally, also think that Revelation is a book about the future.
  - However, John wrote the book to the seven main churches in Asia. Rev 1:44
  - John does not say that after addressing the seven churches individually, the rest of the book is about the future.
    - the WHOLE book was originally written for them.
	- modern scholars consider that people of that time would recognize and have the clearest ideas concerning the images and references John addresses in the book.
	  - it is thought that the further we get from that time, the more obscure the metaphors and references become.

- Some highlights
  - "The assumptions that people make about a text affect the way that they read it."
  - The other book in the Bible most like Revelation is Daniel.
    - Begins with stories about Daniel
	- Ends with visions of beasts, battles, and the coming of the Son of Man.
  - Apocalyptic literature
    - There are many apocalyptic books other than the two main ones in the Bible.
	  - It was a common genre of Biblical times.
	  - some speak of similar events in history: the details are different.
	    - the details are not as important as the message.
	- Filled with symbolic representations of powers well known to the audience.
	- The genre assures readers that God will remain faithful.
	  - God will, in the end, save those who remain faithful to Him.
  - Revelation is different in several respects.
    - primary is that it presents visions in overlapping cycles, not a linear story.
	- since Revelation is literature our book will be considering characters, plot, and narrative.

- Roman Imperialism: Three Dimensions. pg 31
  - Revision of the idea that Christians were purposefully targeted and persecuted by Rome.
    - Some eras this was true.
	- Most persecution was local as Gentiles and Jews took exception to Christian conduct
  - Our study book will look at Christians in the Roman world from three dimensions.
    1. Persecutions.
	   - Local level persecution, not blanket Roman policy.
	   - Visions of horrific persecution beyond what any of the churches have yet experienced.
	     - it magnifies the thread of persecution to show the empire's true character.
         - our faith should take the form of resistence.
	   - Revelations response to injustice is complex.
	     - it does not equate justice with retribution.
	2. Assimilation.
	   - Some churches were eating food used in pagan rituals and participating in gatherings where these rituals took place.
	     - These Christians were attempting to maintain good relations with non-Christians.
	   - Revelation wants to draw a clear distinction between worshiping our creator God and Jesus, versus worship of "the beast," representing pagan and/or human "gods."
	   - Revelation wants to press for clarity of commitment.
	3. Complacency.
	   - Some churches were made up of people who were prospering in the Roman economy.
	   - they seem to be oblivious to the suffering in other churches.
	   - John wants to startle them out of their complacency.
	   - The ways of God are outside the ways of human ideas of success, peace, and prosperity.

- Engaging Current Contexts pg 33
  - "The vivid word-pictures shaped the readers' way of seeing God, themselves, and the world in which they lived."
    - From a contextual point of view, Revelation is closer to the regular prophets of the Bible.
	- they"summoned their hearers to renewed fidelity to God and to a just and compassionate way of life."
  - "The visionary rhetoric also challenges current reader to discern where such forces are at work in their own contexts."
    - How might current situations challenge us to guard ourselves against persecution, assimilation, and complacency.

### Silence or Song?
pg 35

pg 41: "Once of the greatest barriers that people face when opening Revelation is the fear of being confused or misled by its images....Revelation's most abiding contribution has not been to stir people into a frenzy over the date of Christ's return but to give communities of faith some of the language that they have used for generations when giving praise to God and the Lamb."

pg 42: We cannot ignore the warning given in Revelation concerning divine judgement, but the worship scenes should help us interpret those warnings in the light of the promises, "and understand that God's purposes are directed toward the joy of salvation."

### Venturing Forward
pg 42

- How can we best read Revelation given everything we have been talking about so far?

  - Read is to read it as one whole integral book
    - don't chop it up and try to dissect parts on their own.

  - Revelation moves in a non-linear way.
    - this idea comes from Victorinus in the third century, and his commentary which is the oldest still in existence.
	- There are six spirals that overlap with each other.
	  - Rev 1 - 3 - specific messages to the seven churches
	  - Rev 4 - 7 - the seven seals
	  - Rev 8 - 11 - seven trumpets
	  - Rev 12 - 15 - unnumbered visions
	  - Rev 15 - 19 - seven plagues
	  - Rev 19 - 22 - more unnumbered visions.
	- At the end of each cycle there are visions celebrating the triumph of God.
	  - Rev 4:1-11, 7:1-17, 11:15-19, 15:1-41, 19:1-10, 21:1-22:5.
	- The visions alternate threat and assurance.
	- The cycles are like the spiral diagram on page 43.
      - at the bottom of each spiral the intensity increases to threaten the reader's (our) sense of security.
	  - each time it becomes unbearable, the reader is transported into the presence of God.
	    these visions are at the top of each spiral.

  - pg 43:
    - "Revelation is designed to unmask false sources of security while beckoning readers to join the heavenly host in singing praises to God and the Lamb"
    - "...these scenes show us the goal of God's saving work."
    - "Reader will encounter many threatening images..., but those who keep the musical scenes in mind will not lose sight of the book's goal."

  - We will be considering Revelation in a contextual way.
    - we will first ask how the narrative concerned the Christians of John's own time.

## The GOAL of the book
  - pg 44 - last paragraph starting at "Revelation is not a coded collection of secrets...."
    - it invites today's readers to consider ways in which our modern world may resemble the situations of those 1st century Christians, and how the message of Revelation continues to addresses how we should respond to the world and to God.
