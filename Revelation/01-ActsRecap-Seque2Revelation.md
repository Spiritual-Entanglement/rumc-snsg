## The Conclusion of Acts

- **The Main Character**
  - Jesus is the main character through the book.
    - Jesus is only physically present at the beginning.
    - The WHOLE Church is the co-star.
      - Peter, Paul, and the other Apostles and disciples are only the vehicles of the action.
  - Acts does not END; it just stops.
    - the story of Jesus and the church is not yet concluded.

- **Paul in Rome**
  - Acts stops shortly after Paul arrives in Rome.
  - Paul is learning.
    - Invites the Jewish leaders to meet shortly after arrival.
	- Sums up his message: (from NT Wright's Acts for Everyone, Part II pg 245) "that Israel's God, the creator, the God of Abraham, had, in the Messiah, Jesus, claimed His thrown as Lord of the world, the one of whom Caesar was simply a low-grade parody."
    "If He (Jesus) is Messiah, He is the world's true King."
  - The Gospel of Jesus Christ enters Rome much like Jesus entering Jerusalem just before his trial
    - Roman Christians go out to meet Paul to accompany him into Rome.
      - About 100 miles outside of Rome
      - Met Paul at Three Taverns and the Appian Forum
    - He enters humbly as a prisoner of Rome.

## The Victory of Acts

- **Jesus is Lord**
  - The Pauline title of Jesus: "The LORD Jesus Christ"

- **Victory in Unlikely Ways**
  - Paul's vision of Rome
    - Anticipation
	- delay after delay.
  - Luke's story structure
    - Similar to his Gospel
	- Huge, climatic, unexpected disaster near the end.
      - Gospel:
	    - Jesus is killed!  The Messiah is killed!
		- Jesus is ressurected!  What is this?!
		  - This is revolutionary in a completely new sense.
		  - NO ONE has any idea what is coming.
		- Jesus ascends to Heaven.
		  - (In Acts) Jesus sends the Holy Spirit as promised.
      - Acts:
	    - Paul finally underway to Rome.
		- Storm: after days at sea, the ship breaks apart.
		- Shipwrecked.
		- Snake bite.
	    - Acts ends more abruptly
	      - Avoid equating Paul with Jesus.
	      - Paul's story stops abruptly.

- **God's Way**
  - God used the Jewish authorities to arrest Paul.
  - God used the Roman authorities to get Paul to Rome.
  - Christianity is spread throughout the world.
  - God's promise to Abraham to bless the world through his descendants is fulfilled.
  - Christianity eventually conquers Rome itself.
