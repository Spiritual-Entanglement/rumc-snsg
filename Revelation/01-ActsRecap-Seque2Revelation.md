# Recap of Acts

## Summary of the Early Church

- **Growing pains - tests and trials**
  - Working out how to live as a community.
  - Apostles are praying and studying scripture in light of Jesus' teachings.

- **God works in many surprising ways.**
  - Unexpected.
  - Unusual.
  - Miraculous.
  - God is NOT in a hurry.

- **Gentiles are accepted into the church quickly.**
  - Peter is the first to witness to Gentiles.
  - Gentiles were lead by the Holy Spirit
  - Gentiles are baptized.
  - Gentiles are baptized in the Holy Spirit.

- **Saul of Tarsus**
  - an ENEMY of the young church is chosen by God as the Apostle to the Gentiles.
  - He is a ZEALOUS Pharisee from a family of Pharisees.
    - Remember zealots are *not* opposed to using violence to enforce their ideals.
  - Educated & intellectual.
  - Spiritually minded.
    - He knows his scripture, and he knows the Law.
  - From Tarsus.
    - University town.
    - Trading and marketing town. On major trade routes.
    - Roman and Greek philosophers.
    - Nearly a decade in Tarsus thinking out Christian Theology before his major missionary journeys.
      - The early church sent him home because it is prone to causing trouble.
      - I spent nearly a decade in Tarsus before he is called to help in Antioch.
      - He is working out theology in light of his deep knowledge of Jewish history, law, and prophecy.

## The Conclusion of Acts

- **The Main Character**
  - Jesus is the main character throughout the book of Acts.
    - Jesus is only physically present at the beginning.
    - The WHOLE Church is the co-star.
      - Peter, Paul, and the other Apostles and disciples are only the vehicles of the action.
  - Acts' story does not END; the book just stops.
    - the story of Jesus and the church is not yet concluded.
    - the story continues with us...

- **Paul in Rome**
  - Acts stops shortly after Paul arrives in Rome.
  - Paul is learning from past mistakes in other cities.
    - Invites the Jewish leaders to meet shortly after arrival.
	- Sums up his message: (from NT Wright's Acts for Everyone, Part II pg 245)
      >"that Israel's God, the creator, the God of Abraham, had, in the Messiah, Jesus, claimed His thrown as Lord of the world, the one of whom Caesar was simply a low-grade parody."
      "If He (Jesus) is Messiah, He is the world's true King."
  - The Gospel of Jesus Christ enters Rome much like Jesus entering Jerusalem just before his trial
    - Roman Christians go out to meet Paul to accompany him into Rome.
      - About 100 miles outside of Rome
      - Met Paul at Three Taverns and the Appian Forum
    - He enters humbly as a prisoner of Rome.

## The Victory of Acts

- **Jesus is Lord**
  - The Pauline title of Jesus: "The LORD Jesus Christ"

- **God Brings Victory in Unlikely Ways**
  - God gave Paul a vision of Rome, and proclaiming the Gospel there.
    - Anticipation
	- delay after delay.
  - Luke's story structure
    - Similar to his Gospel
	- Huge, climatic, unexpected disaster near the end.
      - Gospel:
	    - Jesus is killed!  The Messiah is killed!
		- Jesus is resurrected!  What is this?!
		  - This is revolutionary in a completely new sense.
		  - NO ONE has any idea what is coming.
		- Jesus ascends to Heaven.
		  - (In Acts) Jesus sends the Holy Spirit as promised.
      - Acts:
	    - Paul finally underway to Rome.
		- Storm: after days at sea, the ship breaks apart.
		- Shipwrecked.
		- Snake bite.
	    - Acts ends more abruptly for two possible reasons:
	      - Avoid equating Paul with Jesus.
	      - Paul's story stops abruptly.
            - Paul is not the point of the story in Acts; Jesus is.

- **God's Way Is different from human ways of power**
  - God used the Jewish authorities to arrest Paul.
  - God used the Roman authorities to get Paul to Rome.
  - Christianity is spread throughout the world from Rome.
  - God's promise to Abraham to bless the world through his descendants is fulfilled.
  - Christianity eventually conquers Rome itself.

## From Acts To Revelation

- **Spiritual Interpretation of Revelation**
  - one of four main interpretations.
  - Christians face persecutions and difficulty like everyone else.
    - Revelation give some extreme examples
  - God's victory over evil in the world.
  - The faithful will ultimately be rewarded.

- **Acts leads into Revelation**
  - This is the perfect study to follow our study of Acts.
    - Revelation is about the Church in the world, not just at the end of time.
  - The Apostles faithfully did their best to follow God through Jesus's teachings.
  - God used their faithful service to spread the Gospel in all directions.
  - God faithfully delivered them from many trials and tribulations.
  - More extreme examples await us in Revelation.
  - In Revelation we get to peek behind the curtain in several visions of Heaven.
    - The scenes in the Heavenly throne room are the point of the story, not the devastation.
