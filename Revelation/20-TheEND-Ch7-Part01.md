# Chapter 7: The End - Cycle 6

Part 1: Pages 168 - 177
- overview - Rev 19-22 - page 168
- The Great Battle - Rev 19:11-21 - page 170
  - Christ the Warrior - Rev 19:11-16 - page 172
  - Victory over the beast and its allies - Rev 19:17-21 - page 174

## The Point:
- "John does not want readers to think that Christ's death as a sacrificial Lamb was intended to placate the forces of sin and evil."
- "Christ died to wrest people from the kingdom of sin so they might serve in the kingdom of God (Rev 1:5-6)."
  - Page 175
  > 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood— 6 and he made us to be a Kingdom, priests to his God and Father—to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

## Overview of Chapter 7 - Rev 19 - 22
- The 6<sup>th</sup> and final cycle.
  - Starts after the marriage feast of the Lamb is announced.
- "Revelation's predictably unpredictable vision of things" there is no ceremony.  That does not come for another 1000 years.
  - The groom, Christ, the Lamb, "[thunders] onto the page to slay the adversaries of God."
- The marriage feast is promised...
  - But first the "supper of God" must take place.
    - It is gruesome and shocking
- Does this mark "the End of all things?"  Page 168
  - John indicates there is more.
    - Satan bound with a chain and thrown into the great abyss.
    - all those killed by the beast are resurrected.
  - The millennial kingdom is not the end either.
    - Satan is released for one final attack.
      - My thought: did some in the millennial kingdom become complacent, so there is one last temptation?
  - The final judgement.  EVERYONE is there.
  - The Bride descends -- the New Jerusalem - Rev 21:1-24
  - Here the visions finally **end**.
- Now a tour of the New Jerusalem
- John reveals the mystery of 'the End'.
  - **"...the End of all things is God and the Lamb."**
  - Now the title makes sense.
  - Rev 21:6, 22:13 God is the Alpha and Omega
    - We circle back to the beginning of the book.
    - Rev 1:8, 17. It was already declared but now the meaning is clear.
  - The visions that follow show
    - **"the end is not an event, but a person (Caird, A Commentary, 266)"**
    - When the visions bring people to faith in God, and moves them to worship God, "it brings them to the End for which the book was written." Page 169.
  - AGAIN: Authentic prophecy moves us to worship God.
    - True prophecy is not about predicting future events.
      - it is about calling people to repentance. Rev 11:3
      - identified by its witness to Jesus and call to worship God. Rev 19:10; 22:9
  - False prophecy draws us away from God.
    - they can also preform some miracles.
    - "What makes them false is that they lure people into a false faith that binds them to powers that masquerade as God while serving the cause of destruction and oppression.
      - Rev 2:20, 13:13-17, 16:13-14, 19:20.
- Page 170 "The peculiar cyclical structure of Revelation..."
  - "God keeps the secrets of his coming hidden from human eyes."
    > Matt 24:36 No one knows the day or hour. The angels in heaven don't know, and the Son himself doesn't know. Only the Father knows. 
  - multiple similar images give the same message in many disguises.
    - we don't know where we are in time.
    - Only God knows the true timing of things, especially the End.
    - God is worthy of our trust and faith.

## The Great Battle - Rev 19:11-21 - Page 170
- (My thoughts) Obsession with and trying to calculate the timing of the End of the World, and working so hard to lineup events and people in the news with events and people in Revelation, is actually a distraction from our ministries and missions to our own faith community and those here around us.
  - Who can stop looking at a "train wreck?"
    - We are fascinated by things like this.
    - I think it is a mixture of fascination, dread, and in some cases relief that it was not us caught up in the "wreck."
- **Armageddon** was mentioned in Rev 16:16.
  - The great battle is described in Rev 19:11-21
  - Revelation's visions seem to get more gruesome as we progress through the book.
  - Modern times try to equate Armageddon with WW III.
    - Normally trying to stitch together verses from other books of scripture.
      - Is 63:1-6 - conflict in Edom (modern Jordan)
      - Joel 3:1-2, 9-17 - Valley of Jehoshaphat.
      - Zech 12:1-9 - focus on Jerusalem
        - Rev 14:14-20; 16:12-16; 19:11-21
    - usually these are combined with modern developments in warfare and politics.
      - Typically by people who have not read the entire book of Revelation nor have any familiarity with with rest of the Bible or the genre of apocalyptic books.
        - they also have a mistaken understanding of what prophecy is and its ultimate goal = ***repentance and worship of God.***
  - Warfare in Revelation is different from man-made warfare. Page 14-17
    - *ONLY* one weapon is mentioned.
      - The WORD of GOD depicted as a sword issuing from the mouth of the rider on the white horse
        - Christ, the Lamb of God. Rev 19:15,21. Page 171
    - John is using visual descriptions (as usual) to describe a conflict that is UNLIKE all conflicts between people vs people; nation vs nation.
      - This is **NOT** a human, military battle or war.
    - The timeline is not consistent through the book.
      - This battle actually started in Rev 12, when Michael and his angels defeated Satan and banished them from Heaven; confining them to Earth.
    - Details about the location or time of events are missing.
      - We don't know *where* Satan and his demons landed with thrown out of heave.
      - We don't have any clues about where the *lake of fire* is or the abyss.
      - We don't know how much *"chain"* is need to bind Satan.
        - Extending the visual language - of what, exactly is this *"chain"* made?
  - Recall the sequence of events in Act II of Revelation. Page 171.
    - They are introduced in order, and conquered in reverse order.
    ```
    Satan is thrown from heaven to earth (Rev 12)
       The Beast and False Prophet conquer (Rev 13)
          The Harlot rides on the beast (Rev 17)
          The Harlot is destroyed by the beast (Rev 17)
       Beast and false prophet are conquered (Rev 19)
    Satan is thrown from earth into the abyss (Rev 20)
    ```
### Christ the Warrior - Rev 19:11-16 - Page 172
- Of course Jesus was introduced at the beginning of Revelation.
  - Rev 19:11 Jesus appears out of Heaven on a white horse.
  - Rev 1:14; 19:12 eyes aflame
  - Rev 1:16; 19:15 The Word of God as a sword proceeding out of Christ's mouth.
  - Jesus gave words of encouragement, reproof, and warning to His followers in the beginning of Revelation.
  - Now, He comes to judge God's/His adversaries that have refused to repent.
- Two riders on white horses.  Page 172
  - Rev 6:1-2, the first seal is broken and a rider on a white horse comes forth.
    - He was release by Christ
    - He has a crown signifying victory.
  - Rev 19:11 Jesus comes forth out of Heaven riding a white horse.
    - He **IS** Christ
    - Jesus has *many* diadems on His head showing divine, royal power.
      - this challenges the dragon and the beasts who wore a small number of diadems in mockery of divine power.
- Identity.  Page 172-173
  - Part of Jesus' identity is hidden. He has a name only He knows.
  - Names carry power and authority.
    - As Christians we ascribe great power to Jesus' name.
  - This hidden name has power only Jesus' can invoke.
    - Only He has access to the authority and power it represents.
  - However, Rev 19:13 clearly shows He wields the name **"Word of God"**
    - He communicates God's will to all creation.
    - He puts God's will into effect.
      > Isa 55:11 so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
    - He also wields the names **King of kings**, and **Lord of lords.** Rev 19:16, which are inscribed on His robe and thigh.
- His Robe. Page 173.  Rev 19:13
  - His robe is already bloody, but it is His blood.
  - Hearing vs Seeing: Again John hears one thing but sees something else.
    - Earlier
      - John **hears** Old Testament promises that the King from David's line would conquer. Rev 5:5
      - John **sees** a slaughtered Lamb who conquered sin and death. Rev 5:6-10.
    - In the Great Battle.
      - Isa 63:2-4 John **hears** the divine warrior talk about treading out justice as if it was a wine press, and all his clothes are stained red.
      - Rev 5:9-10; 19:13 John **sees** Jesus enter with His robe already soaked with His own blood which He shed for people of every nation.
- His Army. Page 174.  Rev 19:14
  - His army is not dressed for battle.
  - They wear pure white linen robes.
    - They represent those who, through faith in Christ's salvific work and His resurrection, have had their sins forgiven.
    - Read the last half of the first paragraph on Page 174, starting with
      > "This means that they are called..."
  - This army accompanies Christ to the battle.
    - Second paragraph on page 174.
    - This army takes no direct violent action.
    - This army has already fought by resisting evil, corruption, and idolatry.
- Only Christ takes action
  - Rev 19:11 "in righteousness he judges and makes war."
  - Rev 19:15
    - "From his mouth issues a sharp sword with which to smite the nations,"
    - "and he will rule them with a rod of iron;"
      - signifies royal rule.
    - "he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. "
      - Isa 63:2-4
  - Christ is the only one with a weapon, and it is God's Word, **not** an actual sword.
  - Only Christ carries out God's will of justice and victory of evil.
### Victory over the Beast and its Allies - Rev 19:17-21 - Page 174
- Now comes the most gruesome part.
  > Page 175 "An angel summons great flocks of birds to what is called 'the great supper of God.'"
  > Rev 19:17-18  Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly in midheaven, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, 18to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.”
  - There really is no battle.
    - immediate defeat of all live creatures (those who have gathered to opposed Christ and have refused to repent) by the "sword" which is God's Word.
    - there is no fighting.
  - The beast and the false prophet are seized and thrown into a lake of fire.
- Our author asks: do we have "tendencies to look at the powers in the world through rose-colored glasses?"
  - Again, John uses images designed to be shocking and disturbing.
    - Remember John has repeated shown there no neutral position.
  - Remember also, that many of John's original readers had compromised their faith and have followed the culture and empire out of complacency.
  - Page 175 "The forces that are defeated in this battle are 'those who destroy the earth (Rev 11:18)."
    - "The allies of these destructive powers were repeatedly given opportunity to repent, but ... refused to do so (9:20-21; 16:9,11)."
    - read more from the bottom of page 175.
- "The love of God and the justice of God converge by bringing the beast's reign to and end." Page 176
- Warning and Promise - Page 176
  - the 'supper of God' is a counterpoint to the 'marriage feast of the Lamb."
  - Warnings and promises both serve the same end
    - they are extended to all people.
      - Revelation envisions all peoples and nations giving glory to God and the Lamb. Rev 5:9-14; 7:9-10
      - Yes, both the great and the lowly must know that those who reject and fight against God will meet their end in destruction. Rev 19:17-21.
  - **WARNINGS**
    - they are constructed to repel people from sin, its consequences, and the pain they cause.
      - designed to bring change, not despair (pages 138-139)
      - some readers look at the descriptions of the unfaithful being hurt or tormented, and feel save; they assume that is not them.
        - remember the churches that are compromising with the Roman Empire (Babylon, the beast, the false prophet) and some are complacent.
      - "Readers best respond to the vision in a manner that is consistent with the rest of Revelation...by heeding the warning and turning..to the ways of God."  Page 176, end of second paragraph.
    - It is easier to give in and accommodate Babylon and the beast.
    - Faithfulness to Christ puts Christians outside of mainstream culture.
      - that can be uncomfortable or even dangerous depending on how bad the current "beasts" are ruling current "Babylon" culture.
  - **PROMISE** 
    - The promises give value to endurance through hard times.
    - they attract people to the ways of God and the Lamb.
    - The marriage feast of the Lamb: This promise is elaborated more in Rev 21.
      - The promise of the marriage feast brings blessings to all who are attendant.
- Hope and Despair. Page 177
  - We see two futures.
    - One in the Heavenly throne room with God.
    - The other is destruction.
  - the warnings show there is judgement for all.
  - the promises show there is hope for all.
  - "Those who fall into despair because the warnings are so severe need to hear again the promises of life through the power of the Lamb..." Page 177
    - *be careful* the promises can also lead us to complacency in exercising out faith.
      - the warnings startle us back to reality and to remain vigilant and remain steadfast to the ways of God.

## The Best Response
- Readers of Revelation can best respond to these contrasting visions, that can invoke both hope and despair by
  - heeding the warnings
  - trust the promises.
> "Faith, which is the alternative to despair and to complacency, is the shape that life takes in anticipation of the End."  Page 177.

Remember, **the End of all things is God and the Lamb.**
