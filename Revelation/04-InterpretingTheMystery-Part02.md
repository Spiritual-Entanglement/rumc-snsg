### Introduction

"The power of a book can be seen in what it does to people..."

This first sentence frames why we need to talk ABOUT the book before we begin studying its content.

Another important point from page 1,<br />
"A sketch of some of the ways in which Christian have interpreted the book over the centuries can provide a valuable preface to reading Revelation."

Our Beliefs and Interpretations
- are shaped by what others have told us during our lives.
- everything we have heard, read, and seen, shapes our current beliefs and assumptions.

It is good to hear if other have a different point of view, and why.

**Revelation has had many interpretations since the days of the early church.**
- It is a message about events to happen in the coming days.
- It is a message about timeless truths about how God relates to ALL generations throughout time.
- It is a message describing events that have already taken place.

### History, Politics, and Reform

#### Questions about History
- changed how people read Revelation
  - changed from a spiritual 
  - became a book about history and/or prediction of the future.

- A quick look from the 11th to the mid 19th centuries
  - Is Revelation so far removed from its original time that became harder to interpret?
  - The 11th Century is the boundary because of Joachim of Fiore

- Joachim of Fiore (1135 - 1202)
  - The reason for putting the eleventh century as a boundary mark is mainly due to the importance of Joachim of Fiore (c 1135-1202), whose work served as "a turning point" in the history of apocalyptic interpretations.  His understanding of prophecy, particularly the Antichrist, modified the interpretations of the preceding centuries, and influenced future generations, including the 16th century Protestant Reformers.  In turn, the understanding of the image of the beast also changed drastically."  [The backgrounds and meaning of the image of the beast in Rev 13:14, 15; Liu, Rebekah Yi.; Andrews University ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,  2016. 10162883](https://www.proquest.com/openview/fc4e40a03b6cbdea6ed202ca75f85d30/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)
  - Divides history into 3 main periods.
    - Father: from creation to the Jesus
	- Son: 
	  - Begins: King Josiah's reforms in the 7th century BC.
	    - 2 Kings 21:26 - 23:30
	    - 2 Chronicles 33:25 - 35:27
	    - Purified the Temple
	    - Brough Israel back into proper workship of God.
	  - Arrives in its fullness with the birth of Christ.
	  - No end (implied?)
	- Holy Spirit: 
	  - Begins: St Benedict's monastic reforms in the 6th century
	  - Not yet fully arrived.
  - Persecutions of the Church during the period of the Son
    - Represented by the 7 heads of the beast
      - major foes of Christianity: Pilot/Herod, Nero, Constantius, Muhammad,
	  - The 5th is unclear: Moors and/or internal corruption in the German Roman empire.
	  - The 6th is Saladin whose Muslim forces capture Jerusalem.
	    - Saladin as a head of the dragon, fueled enthusiasm for some of the Crusades.
	  - The 7th: THE Antichrist - is yet to come
  - the Two Witnesses
    - Revelation talks about two witnesses for God that will be come prominent, will be killed, and later brought back to life.
	- Joachim predicts these to be two new monastic orders.
	  - Many equate them to be the Franciscans and the Dominicans, who form shortly after Joachim's death.
  - 666: The number of the Beast
    - Many numerical analysis of names and translated names are used to identify one person after another as the Beast.
	- They are still doing it today...
  - Year 1260
    - trying to use the genealogy in Matthew to calculate the end of the age.

- Martin Luther (1483 - 1546)
  - Three evolving views of Revelation
    1. Luther dismissed Revelation
	   - little value to Christian faith and life
	   - dangerous speculations about the future.
	   - does not consider it inspired by the Holy Spirit.
	   - does not see Christ in it.
    2. Decodes Revelation in light of political events of his time.
	   - map of history between Jesus' first and second coming.
	     - starts with letter to first century Christians.
		 - ends with vision of New Jerusalem.
		 - the chapters between must cover the years between those events.
	   - identifies the Beast and harlot with the office of the Papacy.
	     - The Papacy will eventually be infultrated and taken over by the Antichrist.
    3. The FUNCTION of Revelation's imagery
	   - this viewpoint is often overlooked
	   - focuses on the central message of Revelation that encourages faith, hope, and perservenance. 
	     - goes beyond trying to reduce Revelation into some kind of secret, coded message.
	   - Addresses the message of warning and promise.
	     - WARNING
		   - The church will be plagued by many heresies and problems
		   - the chruch becomse unrecognizable.
		   - these problems are not unique to any one period in time.
		     - it characterizes the church on earth through out time.
		   - DO NOT "be decieved into despair"
	     - PROMISE
		   - Christ is with us at all times.
		     - if "the word of the gospel remains pure among us, and we love and cherishit, we shall not deoubt that Christ is with us, even when things are at their worst."
		   - Christ and His church win.
		     - for "through and beyond all plagues, beasts, and evil angels, Christ is nonetheless with his saints and wins the final victory."

- John Calvin (1509 - 1564)
  - Surprisingly ignored Revelation

- Two major viewpoints emerge for those who see Revelation as predictions of future events
  - PRE-millennial
    - The Kingdom of God will arrive through (and after) great tribulation and cataclysmic change.
      - tribulation - a cause of state of great trouble or suffering.
    - conditions will get worse and worse until Christ returns.
	- once Christ returns, He establishes His 1000 year reign on earth.
	- Still a very popular interpretation of Revelation.
  - POST-millennial
    - The Battle of Armageddon is not a physical battle, but spiritual.
	- The Kingdom of God comes gradually and progressively over time
      - by missionary, evangelistic outreach of the church.
    - Only after a millennium of this progressively growing Kingdom, does Jesus return.
	- Widespread in colonial America

- Johnathan Edwards (1703 - 1758)
  - Premier theologian in America during his lifetime.
  - Many religious revivals were taking place.
  - people are God's instruments of redemption
  - Eventually God's Kingdom spreads until it is universal.
  - Bowls of divine wrath were being poured out
    - Fifth bowl is the Protestant Reformation.
	- Papacy = 7-headed beast.
  - Expected the nations to be converted to Christ in about 200 years.
    - Year 2000

- Charles Finney (1792 - 1875)
  - evangelist
  - abolitionist
  - termperance
  - Millennial Are 
    - benevolent action
	- can be hastened by our actions
	  - similar to Pharisees: Once everyone is following God's law He will return to the Temple.

- Social Gospel
  - mid 1800s
  - reform society
    - good works
  - little to no emphasis on evangelism or conversion to faith
