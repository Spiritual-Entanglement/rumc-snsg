## Considerations Before Getting into the Scriptures

1. <details><summary>Genre</summary>

   - Three genres in one book: Apocalyptic, Prophetic, and Epistolary.

   - <details><summary>Apocalyptic</summary>

     - Jewish and Christian apocalyptic books not in the Bible.
     - From Greek apocalypsis' meaning 'revelation'
       - did not mean a large-scale disater or end of the world.
     - Revelation is the revealing of something that existed but was previously hidden.
     - Apocalyptic books are not phrophetic in nature.

     - <details><summary>Characteristics of Jewish/Christian apocalyptic books: </summary>

       - symbolism and visions
       - angelic beings media the revelation
       - bizarre imagery
       - divine judgement
       - Kingdom of God
       - New heavens and earth
       - difference between this age and the age to come.
       </details>

     </details>
   - <details><summary>Prophetic</summary>
 
     - Revelation differs from other apocalyptic books by being prophetic.
	 - John declares the book is prophecy several times.
	   - Rev 1:3, 22:7, 22:10, 22:18-19
	 - The author reveals his identity.
	 - The author seems to be known by the recipients.
	 - It is NOT pessimistic about God's intervention in history.
	 - John places himself and the recipients in the same time period.
	   - Many apocalyptic books recast past events as future predictions.
	 - John speaks like OT prophets.
	   - John believes God's Kingdom has already broken into the history of his day.
     </details>

   - <details><summary>Epistolary framework</summary>

     - packaged like other epistles
     - names the sender
     - names the addressees
     - greetings
     - a doxology
     - a postscript (22:10-21)
     </details>

   </details>

2. <details><summary>Authorship</summary>

   - John the Apostle
   - one of the Apostle's disciples
   - John the Baptist
     - not much support for this one.
	 - In Acts 19 Paul met Christians in Ephesus who were diciples of John the Baptist and knew nothing of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
   </details>

3. <details><summary>Date</summary>

   - Nero's reign from AD 54 to 68.
   - Domitian's rule from AD 81 to 96.
   </details>

4. <details><summary>Traditional Materials</summary>

   - 278 versus out of 404 contain allusions to Old Testament.
   - Frequently refers to Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel.
   - Also Psalms, Exedus, and Deuteronomy.
   - John recasts OT images into Christological reinterpretations.
   </details>

5. <details><summary>Leading Interpretations</summary>

   - Preterist - think the events were largely fulfilled in the 1st century AD.
   - Historicist - Believe the events unfold gradually through history.
     - This was the view of many of the Reformers
	 - typically equated the Papacy with the Antichrist.
   - Futurist 
     - the events of Revelation outline a script that will play out in the last days.
	 - The events in ch 4-22 have not yet been fulfilled.
   - Idealist
     - no images and symbolism equate to events in history.
     - Revelation is concerned with timeless truths about the battle between good and evil, and this continues throughout the ages.
   </details>
