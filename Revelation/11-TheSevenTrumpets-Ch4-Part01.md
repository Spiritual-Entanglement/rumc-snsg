### Unit 11 - The Seven Trumpets - Cycle Three - Part 01
FROM: Revelation & the End of All Things by Craig R. Koester
Chapter 4, pages 96-103,  Revelation 8-11
Questions for chapter 4 are on page 204 if you are interested.

Chapter 4: Trumpets of Terror and Hope

- Cycle 2 ends with chapter 8 verse 1, as the seventh seal is opened.
  - the cycle ends with silence
    - Imagine utter silence in the presence of God.
      It is probably as majestic as the heavenly chorus.
  - John does not let us enjoy the silence, because the 3rd cycle is starting.
    - This cycle will be worse than the seals
    - These trumpets destroy the silence like the release of these terrors will destroy vast amounts of creation

- What if?
  - In Ch 6: 9-11 the martyrs ask when they will have justice.
    - What if God were to give them justice right now?
  - The trumpets depict God unleashing His wrath on a world filled with unrepentant people.
    - We "are shown the horror of pitiless wrath..."
    - The horrors released are much more graphic and gruesome than those accompanying the seals.
  - The result is NOT what we would expect:
    - Those who survive these horrors do NOT repent.
    - If anything, they grow even more depraved and turn, to everything _except_ God.
  - The 7<sup>th</sup> trumpet
    - Just like the 7TH seal, there is a break in the action before the 7<sup>th</sup> trumpet
      - An angel will interrupt the destruction
      - John is asked to prophesy again
      - This break explains that what is needed
is not wrath, but witness
    - At this point the two witnesses are introduced.
      - they represent the church
      - they are not welcomed; they are soon killed
      - God raises them from the dead.
        - ***THIS*** display of God's power causes many people to repent.
    - The 7TH trumpet sounds.

**"Repentance, not destruction is what God desires"** pg 97

- Ch 8.2-9:21 the first 6 trumpets
  - Trumpets, in John's time, have two main uses
    - War: used to signal attack or warning of an attack.
    - Worship: used to accompany praise of God
      - The 7TH trumpet will be used to resume worship and praise.
  - **WAIT: BEFORE** the trumpets
    - the incense is added to the prayers of the saints and martyrs
    - BUT when the incense is gone the angel scoops coals and fire from the altar and hurls it all to Earth.
    - The coals and fire descend and set off thunder lightning, and an earthquake
  - Now the angels prepare to blow their trumpets
    - The first 4 trumpets heighten the effect of the coals.
    - They are similar to the four horsemen released with the first 4 seals.
  - First trumpet
    - Mixes fire and hail with blood and scorches a third of Earth
      - one third of vegetation is burnt up.
      - Remember *"green grass"*
  - Second trumpet
    - a mountain on fire is thrown into the sea and pollutes it
      - like blood - no one can or wants to touch it.
    - A third of everything in the sea dies
    - Shipping is cut by a third
      - Suez Canal: Remember recent shipping problems and how that affected the economy.
  - Third trumpet
    - a "star" falls from heaven and poisons a third of the fresh water sources.
  - Fourth
    - a third of all light from the sky is blacked out.


- The opposite of Divine Creation <--> Divine Destruction
  - In Rev 4-5 God is acclaimed the creator
    - Rev 5:13 ***EVERY*** living thing joined in the praises of God with the Heavenly chorus.
    - In Psalms often ***ALL*** of creation, living and non-living, is said to give or show praise for God.
  - What is happening here is Rev 8-9?
  - The trumpet visions are the exact opposite, and their result will be the exact opposite:
    - God as a destructive force will not bring people to worship Him
      - worship does not grow out of force and fear.
    - people will **NOT** turn and praise God.
    - The trumpets show creation "suffering the brunt of divine destruction." (pg 100)

- The sequence and inconsistencies
  - Rev 6
    - "conquest, violence, economic hardship and death" on a large scale. (pg 100)
    - These remove our, and especially the original reader's, sense of security.
    - the sixth seal: the heavenly bodies go dark and the sky disappears.
  - Rev 8
    - The sky and heavenly bodies are back.
    - The previous cycle of death, destruction and hardship are unleashed again.
      - But, it is as if these terrors are new.
      - It does not seem the trumpet events are cumulative to the affects of the seals.
    - Even within this cycle their are clues that these events are not to be taken literally as if they happen in a linear fashion,
      - The green grass.
        - Rev 8: says the "green grass" is burnt up.
        - Rev 9:4 says the "green grass" is protected from the locust.

**"Repentance, not destruction is what God desires"** pg 97

- Repentance is the Goal
  - The effects of the trumpets illustrate events happening to the world around us; not **TO** us.
    - 1<sup>st</sup> trumpet: Fire & hail destroy vegetation.
      - Like Egypt plagues in Ex 9:13-35
    - 2<sup>nd</sup> trumpet: sea turns to blood.
      - Economic loss due to loss of ships.
    - 3rd trumpet: poisoned water
    - 4TH trumpet: loss of a third of natural light.
  - Contrasts (pg 101)
    - Redeemed are washed by the blood of the Lamb.
      - The condemned are awash in blood of judgement.
    - followers are saved from scorching heat (Rev 7:16)
      - the unfaithful are doused with fire f- o-heaven.
    - The Lamb provides living water - the water of life..
      - Those who turn away have only bitter, poison water.
    - followers will **not** be struck by the sun (Rev 7:16),
      - during judgement the sun itself is struck (Rev 8:12).

- Trumpets 5& 6.
  - The Eagle flies through to say, "You haven't seen anything yet."
  - Fifth trumpet releases tons of smoke and gas from below the Earth.
    - The world gets even darker with all the smoke in the atmosphere.
    - The locusts emerge from the smoke (9:3-11)
      - These are not locusts like man has ever seen before.
        - hideous
    - Heaven vs the Underworld. (pg 102) (Rev 9:11)
      - what if Satan was let off his leash?
      - what if God really let evil have full control?
  - Sixth trumpet (pg 102) (Rev 9:13)
    - A HUGE calvary attacks
      - One third of people are killed.

- A different approach is needed  (Rev 9:20-21)
  - The survivors DO NOT repent.
  - They sink deeper into depravity and evil. (pg 103)

**"Repentance, not destruction is what God desires"** pg 97

In the midst of the graphic horrors brought by the first six trumpets, God will demonstrate how the power of witness of the church, and the part the martyrs have played will bring people to repentance. 

We have already seen in our study of Acts, and we know from the Gospels, God has demonstrated that mankind's concept of power, might, and force normally lead only to bad, painful, and tragic ends, especially for the innocent.

The Savior of the World was crucified by the world.
The Gospel marched into Rome as a prisoner of Rome.

God will show in Rev 10-11, that supposed weakness will win the majority of people to repentance, **NOT** threats of more violence and destruction.
