## The Great Harlot: page 151-152, Rev 17:1-18

**THE MESSAGE** of Chapter 17:
"The sobering message of this vision is that God's judgment is carried out when he allows those who wreak destruction to become victims of their own practices."

- Remember, the woman who is pursued by the dragon, and takes refuge in the wilderness at the start of Act II of Revelation.
  - The Harlot is the counterpart of the woman.
  - Rev 12:1-6 Review
    - She gives birth to a Son.
    - The dragon wants to devour the Son.
    - God immediately takes the Son up to Heaven
    - The woman flees into the desert and is cared for there by God.
- The harlot is the counterpart to 'the woman' in Rev 12.
  - John is carried away to a wilderness where he receives this vision and its explanation.
    - "...allowing him to see this insidious power for what it is." Page 151 bottom.
- Sharp contrasts
  - Both mothers
    - Rev 12: the woman is Mother of Jesus, Mother of God, Mother of the church.
      - In some points of view the woman represents the church itself.
    - Rev 17: the harlot is the mother of prostitutes and abominations
  - The Dragon
    - Rev 12: The seven-headed dragon wants to devour her son.
      - She flees to the wilderness for protection from the dragon.
    - Rev 17: the harlot is riding one of the seven-headed dragons
  - Image
    - Rev 12: the woman has an image of purity and reverence for God.
    - Rev 17: the harlot is responsible for much deviant behavior.
  - The wilderness or the mainstream
    - Rev 12: the woman flees and lives in the wilderness.
      - she is outside the mainstream culture.
    - Rev 17: the harlot is living in the midst of the corruption.
      - she is fully partaking of mainstream life in the heart of Babylon.
- Good and Evil were not so obvious
  - Some of the seven churches cannot distinguish
    - between the ways of God and the ways of the Empire.
    - between faithfulness and unfaithfulness.
    - The churches in Sardis and Laodicea are complacent due to their wealth.
      - Rev 3:1-6, 14-22
    - The churches in Pergamum and Thyatira were accommodating pagan religious practices and rituals.
      - Rev 2:14, 20-22
  - John means to shock the churches into recognizing how easily their senses can be dulled by the culture's "seductive social, economic, and religious forces". Page 152e.
- Feminine Imagery
  - Heavy on Stereotypes
    - Positive: mother (12:1-17) and bride (19:7-8, 21:2-9)
    - Negative: the harlot (17:1-18)
  - It is familiar practice to refer to many items, including cities and nations, with feminine pronouns.
    - John is using common feminine images to make a "scathing social critique." Page 152f.
      - He is using much of the behavior of the Roman empire as attributes and behaviors typical of negative feminine images.
    - My opinion is the imagery stands out in more contrast and is more shocking than if John used masculine imagery.

### Satire
- John makes use of satire in his portrayal of the harlot.
  - How satire works: page 153.
  - Exaggeration of identifiable traits or behaviors.
  - Relations ships are depicted by action between parties.
  - Identity is sometimes written on a character for clarity.
  - Humor helps persuasion.
  - Objective: page 153c
    - "what appears impressive is actually ridiculous"
    - "what seems glamorous is really garish"
    - "what appears desirable is in fact ludicrous"
- The Great City: Babylon
  - Represents everything wrong and foul in mainstream culture.
  - It represents everything that is counter to following Christ.
  - John writes Babylon the Great on the Harlot's forehead to identify her with the mainstream culture.
    - Her description from far away may seem desirable.
    - Up close she is seen to be repulsive.
- Stock Imagery from the Old Testament
  - Marriage. God the husband, Israel the bride. Page 155.
    - Adultery is committed by worshiping other God directly or indirectly.
    - The harlot, Babylon, is enticing God's people to be unfaithful.
    - Examples
      - Tyre - page 155b
      - Nineveh - Page 155c
      - The REAL Babylon - Page 155d
- Rome as Babylon - page 155f
  - John's readers would easily equate the harlot with Rome.
    - the city on seven hills.
  - But not all Christians would see Roman rule as intolerable.
    - The Empire was huge: Europe, Asia, and Africa.
    - Sea trade
    - could be peaceful in some areas
  - Using the Goddess Roma
    - a common image members of the seven churches would know.
    - She personified Roman power.
      - she is a noble woman.
      - Dressed for battle - power, force, might.
      - reclining on seven hills - power-base of the city of Rome.
      - her foot stretches to the Tiber River
      - left hand raised and resting on a short sword.
    - John re-imagines her.
      - seven hills become seven-headed dragon
      - her had hold a golden cup (economic prosperity)
        - but it is filled with blood and other vile things.
          - represents compromises you have to make to gain that prosperity.
      - the "noble" woman is drunk.
      - this woman of a powerful empire is the mother of practices that include prostitution and abominations.
        - to gain her favor you will have to partake of these things.
- page 156e: "John's lampoon of the great harlot was designed to move first-century reader to resist being seduced by the power and wealth or Rome into compromising their loyalties to God, Christ, and the Christian community."
  - But the description of the harlot is not limited just to one city in one time.
    - The description fits many cultures throughout human history.

### The Significance of the Harlot, page 156, Rev 17:7-18.
The angel explains the harlot and the beast. Rev 17:7
- Previously the beast mimicked Christ.
  - an obviously fatal head would, but it is still alive!
    - is it immortal?!
- Now the beast mimics God in the wording used.
  - this heightens the conflict between God and Satan.
  - Rev 17:8 - "The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come..."
  - Yet the direction the beast is going leads to destruction.
  - God is leading to the new creation. Rev 21:1.

#### Stop decoding
- John is not wrapping the beast in a coded messages, but using symbols for multiple meanings. Page 157.  Rev 17:9 
  - The seven heads represent seven mountains.  
  - ALSO, seven kings.
    - 5 who have fallen
    - 1 still living
    - 1 coming that will reign for a short time.
    - 1 comes back and rules with 10 lesser "kings"
      - the 10 horns on the beast.
    - all make war on the saints.
- Future
  - some try to decode the headlines to fit Revelation.
- Past: which 7 "kings"
  - page 158, "No enumeration of Roman emperors fully suits Revelation 17."
    - some thought the returned king was Nero since there were rumors he was not dead.

#### The End of the story.  Page 158
- The ultimate end is clear: Evil self-destructs.
  - The "kings" destroy the Harlot in the end.

**The Message** of chapter 17, Page 159
"The sobering message of this vision is that God's judgment is carried out when he allows those who wreak destruction to become victims of their own practices."
