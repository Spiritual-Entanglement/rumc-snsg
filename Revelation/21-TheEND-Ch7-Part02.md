## The Point
- Trust that God wants you to be with Him in Heaven.
- Trust that the Lamb (Jesus Christ) died for you.
- "Trust that God wants you to put your faith into practice"

## The Millennial Kingcom - Rev 20:1-6
### Binding of Satan - Rev 20:1-3 - Page 177
- An angel bind Satan with a great chain
  - He is the real power behind the beast and the false prophet.
  - Satan already suffered a defeat.
    - Thrown to Earth, and banned from Heaven.  Rev 12.
  - The beast and false prophet have been seized and thrown into the pit or lake of fire
  - Now "Satan is exposed and vulnerable..."
  - The angel throws Satan into the abyss, and locks it closed.
    - Now he cannot even act on Earth for "1000" years.
  - The Abyss
    - Previously and angel *opened* the abyss which released foul smoke.
      - the Destroyer and its locust-like creatures emerged.
    - The Beast had also emerged from the abyss.
    - Now Satan is thrown in and it is closed and locked.
#### Space and Time
- Again John is using vivid images to describe things that do not fit neatly into linear space and time.
- Space
  - John knows Satan is a real force which influences the real world with its evil.
    - Obviously, John does not think Satan is a real dragon or even that he has a real physical body that can be bound by a physical chain.
    - there is no physical location where the angel my capture and bind Satan.
    - no location of the bottomless pit is given.
    - Again, as we know, "John uses physical and spatial images for spiritual realities." Page 179.
      - This will be true in his description of the Saints in Rev 20:4-6
- Time
  - Satan is bound for "1000 years." Rev 20:2
    - Time and again we have seen John use time periods to point out realities that cannot be measured on real calendars.
      - Here 1000 years indicates a time period that is not measurable.
  - Examples:
    - Rev 17:12 says the kingly allies of the beast receive power "for one hour."
    - The 3.5 years, 42 months, and 1260 days all indicate times of oppression or suffering.
      - the actual times varies.  The time period is a symbol.
    - Rev 7:4-8 The number of the redeemed around the Heavenly throne.
      - 12 x 12,000 - indicates fullness and perfection.
      - But in Rev 7:9 says there are so many they cannot be counted.
    - Rev 21:6 - will describe the dimensions of the New Jerusalem as a perfect square of 12,000 units per side.
      - How would we all fit?
      - it signifies fullness and perfection.
- Satan locked up for 1000 years indicated how perfectly he is confined.
### Reign of the Saints - Rev 20:4-6 - Page 179
- After Satan is locked away, the "millennial kingdom" starts: the saints **reign with** Christ for 1000 years.
- Tradition over the last 2000 years has speculated about this time period a lot.
  - See the author's note at the bottom of page 180.
    - Pre-millennialism - says Christ's 2nd coming takes place **before** this "1000 year" kingdom.
      - See chapter 1 section "Raptures, Tribulation, and Armageddon."
    - Post-millennialism - says Christ's 2nd coming takes place **after** this "1000 year" kingdom.
      - See section titled "History, Politics, and Reform"
    - A-millennialism - "theological systems that do not include an explicit thousand-year period in their understanding of time."
- Normally these verses from Isaiah are used to describe this time.
  - Common speculation is that this kingdom will be on earth.
  - Our author referenced Isa 65:20-21,25.
  - But, you could start from verse 17. Isa 65:17-25
    > 17  “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.
    - this describes a time of utter peace among peoples.
    - Verse 25 indicates "...a transformation of the natural order..." Page 180.
    > 25  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, says the Lord.”
  - Some also reference Isa 2:2,4.
    > 2 It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it,
    > 4 He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
- ***HOWEVER*** John does not use any Old Testament passages to describe the millennial kingdom.
  - His description contains "...remarkably spare prose..."  Page 180.
  - the passage in Revelation is "...in many ways ambiguous." Page 180.
  - Our author, included his own literal translation on pages 180-181.
    - There is where interpreters incorporate all the OT promises.
    - John relies on Isiah 65:17.  (see verse quoted above.)
      - in Rev 21:1 will be the New Jerusalem spoken of in Isaiah 65.
- On Heaven or Earth?
  - John does not tell use where this millennial kingdom takes place.
  - Earth?
    - scenes that will follow talk of more opponents of God coming to attack the saints.
      - fire from Heaven will fall on them.
  - Heaven?
    - John says in the vision that he saw thrones.
      - all previous thrones for God and the elders have been in Heaven.
  - John's vagueness reminds us **not** to speculate about things we cannot know with too much confidence that we have it all figured out.
- Relationship **NOT** Geography
  - John does not say *where* the saints reign.
  - John only say with whom they reign: "*they reigned* **with** *Christ*"
  - Where are they?  "With Christ."
  - This "points us to the heart of the life in the millennial kingdom. John is more concerned with "who" than with "where." Page 181.
  - What more do you really need to know?
- Who reigns with Christ, exactly?
  - Again John's words are ambiguous.
  - They are described in three ways:
    1. those who sit on thrones.
    2. those who were beheaded for their witness.
    3. those who had not worshipped the beast.
  - Is this 1, 2, or 3 groups of people?  See Page 182.
  - Greek word *martys* means "witness."
    - Not necessarily those who were killed because of their witness.
    - But this is how we use it today...
    - the second group, more than likely, probably means anyone who was killed because of their faith and witness.
      - Faithfulness is the point, not *how* a Christian dies.
    - All readers are called a faith and endurance that could accept martyrdom if necessary.
  - Two resurrections.
    - The First resurrection is for those who have died in their faith.
      - These are the ones who reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom.
      - my reading of this scripture and section on the bottom of page 182, makes me think this resurrection is for any Christian who died with their faith intact.
      - These faithful don't seem to be facing judgment.
      - They are also said to be safe from "the second death."
    - The Second Resurrection takes place after the millennial kingdom.
      - Rev 20:11-15.
      - *ALL* the rest of humanity is raised.
      - This group faces judgment.
        - *Some* receive eternal blessing.
          - Does this make my idea above incorrect regarding who is included in the first resurrection?
        - *The rest* receive eternal punishment; the second death.
    - Other references to two resurrections and judgment.
      - Dan 12:2; John 5:28-29; Acts 24:15.
    - **AGAIN** Revelation is unique.
      - The first group is separated from the second by "1000 years."
      - There is incentive to be a part of that first group.
      - The faithful will be vindicated.
      - Again the design is to have hope, not despair.
      - The Result: **ALL** the redeemed receive everlasting life and reign with Christ forever. Rev 22:5.
        > And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and ever.
## Final Conflict and Final Judgment - Rev 20:7-15 - Page 183
### Victory Over Satan and His Allies - Rev 20:7-10
- No more is really revealed about the millennial kingdom.
- The scene quickly shifts to Satan's release from the abyss.
  - He gathers Gog and Magog.
    - Names that come from Ezek 38-39.
  - The number that attack the saints is like the sands of the sea.
    - The second resurrection has not happened yet, and the judgment happens after that.
      - this attacking army must be made up of those alive who still refuse to repent. 
  - Rev 20:9 - fire consumes this army before it can even fully attack the saints.
  - Rev 20:10 - Satan is thrown into the lake of fire where the beast and false prophet were thrown.
  - John is not following Ezekiel's vision exactly.
    - the birds that feast on the slain.
      - In Ezekiel these come at the end. Ezek 39:17-20.
      - John has them show up before the millennial kingdom begins.
    - Gog and Magog
      - Ezekiel starts with Gog from the last of Magog.
      - John has them come at the end of the millennial kingdom.
  - John is fashioning this vision closely to Ezekiel's.
    - the outcome in Ezekiel is Israel's deliverance
    - John's outcome is the deliverance of the Church which is Israel and Gentiles.
    - John does not seem to be concerned about getting the sequence of events correct.
    - Deliverance is what is important here.
  - The Principle players in this episode
    - Satan.
      - served a "1000 year" prison sentence.
      - "...he promptly resumes his former way of life..." Page 184.
        - he convinces a large group to oppose God.
        - In Rev 12, he started a revolt, and Micheal and his angels kicked Satan out of Heaven.
          - defeat has not changed his attitude.  He has not changed.
            - he immediately started another revolt when he got to earth. Rev 12:13-17. 
            - In Rev 16:13-14 he gathered the kings and their armies for an attack.  Remember the foul frog-like spirits.
          - He has learned nothing.
          - He does not change or compromise.
      - those who encounter Satan's power must resist without compromise, and hold confident that God ***will*** end Satan's rampage.
    - The Nations
      - During the millennium Satan's evil influence cannot deceive the nations.
      - the millennial kingdom is focused on Christ and his saints reigning without interruption of evil influences.
      - Where then, does Satan immediately find "nations" with which to attack the saints?
        - How can evil still affect the saints after so long with no evil influence?
        - Again, John is trying to startle and shock us.
          - We are *never* safe from evil's touch on our soul
          - "This passage offers a pointed commentary on the human condition by indicating that whenever Satan is active, some will indeed be responsive to him. Any kingdom short of the new creation...will include those who have a propensity to evil." Page 185.
      - "**Restraining evil is not enough.**" It must be brought to an end.
    - The Saints
      - the First resurrection brings the saints alive to reign with Christ.
      - They are priests of God and are not subject to condemnation. Rev 20:4-6.
      - They are residing in a "camp" which may be a flash back to Israel wondering in the wilderness.
      - But they have a "city" which makes us think of Jerusalem.
      - The image is all the saints with Christ, living quiet peaceful lives.
      - Gog and Magog come to destroy it.
        - this is very disturbing reminder that people never possess peace because of our own efforts.
        - only God delivers peace, security, and salvation.
### Resurrection and the Last Judgment - Rev 20:11-15
Page 185.
- The **POWER** of God comes out in this scene
  - GOD is sitting on the Great White Throne center stage
  - The earth and the sky flee, but find no place to rest.
  - The faithful are already alive
  - Now the *second* resurrection is for everyone else.
    - The sea, Death and Hates give up all the dead in them.
    - They all stand before God's throne.
  - Two books are opened to conduct the judgment.
    - The book of life: divine grace
      - like a civic record of citizens of the city of God.
      - John already mentioned this book.
        > Rev 13:8 All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast — all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.
        > Rev 17:8 The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come.
      - Read from page 186 starting with "John has already said..." to end of that paragraph, "...were condemned by human beings."
    - A book of deeds: human accountability
      - The idea of a book to keep track of deeds
        - The book of Esther 6:1-2 talks of a book the king kept to record peoples good deeds.
        - Dan 7:10 speaks of a book opened before God as multitudes are gathered around him as part of Daniel's dream of four beasts.
        - The New Testament records several places the idea of a final judgment. Matt 25:31-46; John 5:28-29; 1 Cor 3:10-15; 2 Cor 5:10.
      - The main idea I get from the words of Christ are how we responded to the vulnerable people who are a part of our lives.
#### The Second Death - Rev 20:13-15 - Page 186
- The adversaries of God are thrown into the lake of fire: Satan, the beast, the false prophet, Death, and Hades.
  - fiery condemnation.
  - Jesus mentions this in, for example, Matt 13:36-43, 47-52; Luke 16:19-31.
- **How should we take these threats?**
  - Again: Warnings are not given to cause despair
    - they are meant to bring change and avert disaster.
  - "John understands that the thread of divine judgment is real.
    **AND**
    - "the hope of avoiding judgment is real."
    - Rev 14:9-11 - a previous warning of fiery judgment.
      - was "a call to faithfulness and a promise of blessing."
        - Rev 14:12-13.  Pages 137-139.
    - Also the verses describing the fall of The Great City, aka Babylon, were a call to turn away for sin and unfaithfulness.
  - "Warnings of judgment are designed to unsettle the readers."
  - "...the promises of salvation and blessing are designed to encourage them.
- God's Grace - page 187
  - "God's decision finally is based on the grace that is represented by the book of life."
  - read that whole 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph before The New Jerusalem starts.
    - Trust that the Lamb died for you.
    - "Trust that God wants you to put your faith into practice"
  - I get concerned about timing...
    - Is it too late for me to start living my faith.
    - The lesson I have learned so far, is that ***now*** is the right time to start live out faith.
      - through prayer and scripture and our church community, God will put on our hearts things He wants us to do.
