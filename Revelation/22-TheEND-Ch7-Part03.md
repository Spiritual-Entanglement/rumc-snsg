# Chapter 7: The End - Cycle 6

Part 3: Pages 187 - 201
- The New Jerusalem - Rev 21:1-22:5 - Page 187
  - Creator and New Creation - Rev 21:1-8 - Page 188
  - Holy City -- Holy People - Rev 21:9-21 - Page 190
  - Glory to God and the Lamb - Rev 21:22 - 22:5 - Page 194
- The End is Near - Rev 22:6-21 - Page 197

## The Point(s):
- "Revelation is part of a long story in which people are repeatedly drawn away from Israel's God, so that they worship the gods of the Nations.
  - "The vision of the New Jerusalem is the rightful culmination of this story, for in it the situation is reversed, and the nations come to worship God."
    - This is the future that was promised, hoped for, and foretold by the prophets.
- Revelation's disturbing visions and dire warnings
  - are **not** simple predictions
  - they are designed to move the original readers
    - "to renewed lives of faith and faithfulness" - page 201
    - "to repentance and endurance" - page 201
- A true Prophet moves people to repentance and worship of God.
  - Prophecy is about proclaiming God's message to the people.
  - It is **NOT** predicting the future although it can sometimes contain predictions.
  - The measuring stick is do people move closer to God or farther away.

## THE NEW JERUSALEM - Rev 21:1 - 22:5 - Page 187
- Overview
  - This last cycle is now on the upward swing to its culmination.
  - Remember the old earth and heavens have fled from the Great While Throne as it appeared, and the One Who Sits Upon It.
  - This section starts with a panoramic view of the new heavens and earth.
  - The New Jerusalem is lowered from the New Heaven to the New Earth.
  - An angel brings us (John) closer to the city to get a closer look.
  - Then we go into the city.
  - In the city we discover the River of the Water of Life.
    - If flows *from* the Throne of God and the Lamb.
    - The Tree of Life is there also.
  - We move closer to the Throne where everyone is gathered to worship.
  - Finally we actually **see** the Face of God.
  - His reign will last forever.

### Creator and New Creation - Rev 21:1-8 - Page 188
- "Revelation envisions the salvation of the while of creation,...) - Page 188
  - Not just people.
  - John is showing/tell us that God's purpose is a totally new creation.
  - Recall in the beginning the four creatures.  Only one was like a human.  The others were like a lion, an ox, and an eagle.
    - They primarily lead praise and worship in Heaven. Rev 4:6-11.
  - In many places the Bible mentions **ALL** of creation worshipping and praising God...including Jesus Christ himself.
    - Old Testament
      > **Psalm 19:1** – “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.”
      > **Psalm 96:11-12** – “Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it; let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy.”
      > **Psalm 98:7-9** – “Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell in it! Let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.”
      > **Psalm 148:1-10** – This entire psalm calls on everything—angels, sun, moon, stars, sea creatures, mountains, trees, animals, and people—to praise the Lord.
      > **Isaiah 55:12** – “For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.”
    - New Testament
      > **Luke 19:40** – “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.” (Jesus speaking about the praise of His followers)
      > **Romans 8:19-22** – “For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God… For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.” (Creation longs for redemption and restoration)
      > **Revelation 5:13** – “And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, ‘To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!’”
    - Creation is not just about us.
- The New Creation is absent of any powers that oppose God.
  - There are no forces that diminish life.
    - The Harlot diminished life by reducing all things, including people, to commodities to be bought and sold by the rich and powerful. Rev 18:11-19.
    - The Dragon, the beast, the false prophet, and their allied kings, oppressed, threatened, and killed the faithful. Rev 19:19-21; 20:7-10.
    - The first and second resurrection ended death. Rev 20:14.
    - There is an absence of pain, morning, crying, etc.
      - These things have passed away.
  - There **IS** the Presence of God
    - A voice from the Throne declares that God dwells among us.
    - and we are His people.
    - We are free to drink from the River of the Water of Life that flows from the Throne.

#### Faithful and True - Page 189
- This section recalls many Old Testament prophets.
  - New Heaven and New Earth: Isa 65:17
  - The decent of the New Jerusalem: Isa 51:1; 61:10; 65:18.
  - God will dwell among His people: Ezek: 37:27; Zech 2:10-11; 8:8.
  - No more death or crying: Isa 25:8.
  - Morning, crying, pain end. Isa 65:17, 19.
  - God makes all things new: Isa 43:19
  - God is the beginning and the **end**: Isa 44:65
  - God gives the Water of Life to the thirsty: Isa 55:19
- Back to reality.  God is faithful and true...
  - But, are John's readers - the 7 churches and now us?
  - The letters to the churches call them to "conquer" by their faithfulness to God and the Lamb.
    - "The Lamb 'conquered' by offering himself as a sacrifice for others before being raised to everlasting glory." Rev 5:5-6.
    - The Church is called to be part of the resistance movement against pressures to compromise faith.
    - "...each message to the churches ends with a promise to the 'the one who conquers..." Page 189 bottom.
  - Now John wants to expand their/our vision from the hardships of the present moment to imagine what God has prepared for those who are faithful to the end.
  - "...the outcome of faith is inheritance of all the blessings of life **in the presence of God**."  Rev 21:7 - page 190 top.  Emphasis in the quote is mine: DAH.
  - Naturally, John includes another warning and gives a list of all who will not be included in the city of God. Rev 21:8
    - Who, being honest, has not committed some related sin on the list?
    - We understand the **no one** is without sin and is subject to judgment.
    - The totality of scripture tells us there is hope.
      - "God's city is not reserved for those who have never sinned but for those who are cleansed by the blood of Christ." Rev 7:14; 22:14 - Page 190.
      - interestingly, verse 22:15 says, "Outside are the (huge list of grievous sins) ... and everyone who **loves** and **practices** falsehood."
        - I take away from the verse is talking about people that refuse to repent and do everything they can to be faithful.
  - The sins are listed in Rev 21:8 to wake people up and have us repent, trust in God's Grace, Jesus Christ's victory,
    - **AND** remain part of the resistance to evil in our lives and the world.
    - to **conquer**

### Holy City -- Holy People - Rev 21:9-21 - Page 190
- Before Rev 21...
- A Tale of Two Cities
  - The Harlot City identifies unfaithfulness
    - populated by many pagan temples
    - seduction of wealth.
    - control by threats of violence and death
    - John tries to expose the seamy side of all the wealth and power that is so alluring.
    - The harlot's "future is bleak and leads to destruction." Page 191
  - **The Holy City** (before the New Jerusalem) identifies faithfulness
    - The Temple *is* the people of God: the Church.
    - The people of God are compared to the 'Woman' saved from the dragon in the wilderness.
    - The people of God actually live among that opponents of God.
      - My thought: a city within a city.
- Not all in the 7 churches would recognize how the city they lived in might lure them into unfaithfulness.
  - John aims to shock them into recognizing the sin that creates wealth, power, and results in oppression and destruction.
- **BUT** if life can be "good" and "peaceful" by going along with culture and the empire,
  - why sign up with God's side to face oppression, being ostracized,  threats, maybe even an early death?
  - The Holy City "extends a hope worth living for." page 191
  - "Readers have incentive to identify with the community of faith in the present, despite the challenges involved, **because faith has a future**." (emphasis mine) page 191 middle.
  - "The bride personifies the community of the redeemed in glory, a city that encompasses the while people of God." page 191
    - Twelve Gates each named after a tribe of Israel. Rev 21:12-14
      - each made from on solid pearl.
    - Twelve foundations named after the twelve apostles. Rev 21:12-14
    - Dimensions are 12,000 on each side representing completeness 
    - Dressed in fine linen and 'jewels'.
    - streets of gold.
- Comparisons - page 192
  - celebration at the marriage feast of the Lamb 19:7,9
    - no reason for bride and groom to celebrate in Babylon Rev 18:4
  - God dwells in the New Jerusalem with His people. 21:3
    - Babylon  is the dwelling of demons. 18:2
  - The Bride manifests the Glory of God 21:11-12
    - Babylon exhibits splendor that comes off the backs of exploited people.
  - No impurity in the New Jerusalem 21:27 (death, morning, crying, pain, are not there.)
    - Babylon is filled with impurity and deception 17:4-5; 18:23
  - The Bride invites people to drink from the River of the Water of Life, and healing from the Tree of Life. 22:1-5
    - Babylon *makes* people practice pagan worship and sin.
- The shape of the New Jerusalem expresses perfection. page 192 bottom
  - The measurement is used to show the **quality** of life in eternity, not the literal shape of the city.
  - John description goes beyond previous prophets descriptions to demonstrate that God will surpass our expectations.
    - Ezek 40:1-4; 43:1-5; 47:1-12; 48:8-9, 30-35.
  - The cubic shape suggests the while city is a Sanctuary. 1 Kings 6:20.
    - see middle paragraph on page 193 
  - No city on earth is like this, not even well planned Roman cities.
    - God's reign is entirely different from human society and design.
- **"The vision of God's kingdom can shape life in the present,"** but our imaginations are inadequate to fulling encompass it. Page 193 bottom.

### Glory to God and the Lamb - Rev 21:22 - 22:5 - Page 194
- Pop culture depicts the Pearly Gates as one gate with closed doors.
  - Normally rests on top of fluffy white clouds.
  - St Peter is usually the apostle you see to gain admission
    - or not.
- John's vision
  - *Twelve* gates: three per side.  Accessible from all directions: North, South, East, and West.
  - Always open. Rev 21:15
    - designed for access, not to keep people out.
  - ALL the apostles would be inside worshipping, not standing guard.
- There is *no* temple building in the City.
  - God and the Lamb *are* the Temple
    - "The End" is not an event but actually God and the Lamb.
    - "The Temple" is not a building but actually God and the Lamb.
  - The city if filled with the Glory of God.
    - No external light sources needed.
    - Nothing focuses light *on* God and the Lamb.  Glory shines from them.
- The Nations and Kings are the worshippers.
  - indicates people from everywhere.  People and earthly kings who repented.
  - Some nations and kings were captivated with the Dragon, the beast, the false prophet, and the Harlot -  the great city.
    - many of them fought God internally and externally, and never repented.
    - They were/are doomed to destruction if they do not repent.
  - Other nations and kings recognized, in humility, that Christ, the Lamb, "offered himself to liberate people of every nation to serve God." Page 195
    - They follow a path of glorifying God on themselves.
- Revelation Act I, God lessened the destruction befalling creation, and many repented and gave Him glory. Rev 11:13
- Revelation Act II, those who conquer the beast recognize God is the King of the Nation and worship Him alone.
- The end of the vision of New Jerusalem shows God's will is for the redemption of the nations.
  - Instead of the voice declaring "they will be my people" it uses the plural: "they will be my peoples."
#### the Point revisited - Page 195
- "Revelation is part of a long story in which people are repeatedly drawn away from Israel's God, so that they worship the gods of the Nations.
    > **Deut 6:14** You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you,
    > **Judges 6:** <sup>11</sup>The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals. <sup>12</sup>They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger. <sup>13</sup>They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
    > **1 Kings 14:** <sup>23</sup>For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. <sup>24</sup>There were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel.
  - "The vision of the New Jerusalem is the rightful culmination of this story, for in it the situation is reversed, and the nations come to worship God."
    > **Isaiah 60:1-3,5,11 -** <sup>1</sup> “Arise, shine; for your light has come, and Yahweh’s glory has risen on you! <sup>2</sup> For behold, darkness will cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you, and his glory shall be seen on you. <sup>3</sup> Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising. ... <sup>5</sup> Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart will thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you. The wealth of the nations will come to you. ... <sup>11</sup> Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
    - This is the future that was promised, hoped for, and foretold by the prophets.

#### New Eden? - Page 196 - Rev 22:1-3
  - The River of the Water of Life and the Tree of Life might suggest a new Eden that supplies all life-giving sustenance.
  - Genesis tells how only after the fall was humankind required to toil to sustain life and still eventually die.
  - in the City of God, the New Jerusalem, death is done away with as are pain, crying, and morning.

#### The Face of God - Page 196 - Rev 22:4-5
- in the story of Adam and Eve, before the Fall, they walked with God in the Garden.
  - after the Fall, humankind cannot look on the Face of God and live.
    - Adam and Eve hid themselves from God in shame
    - God told Moses, no one can see God's face and live. Exod 33:20.
    - Isiah was lost in despair after seeing God in a vision. Isa 6:5.
    - "God's burning holiness can destroy those who come directly into His presence." Page 196
      - Therefore the high priest only enters God presence in the Holy of Holies under a think cloud of incense. Exod 28:36-38; Lev 16:11-1
  - in the New Jerusalem, we **can** see God's Face.
    - people *run* to God and see His face directly.
    - all people serve as a high priest. Rev 22:4
    - the radiance supplies all the light needed.
    - finally humankind can see God's Face again.
  - the redeemed will live in God's presence forever.


## The End is Near - Rev 22:6-21 - Page 197
- Remember, "The End" is not an event...
- Fade out from the scenes of the New Jerusalem...
  - back to reality... back to ordinary life.
- Revelation now paraphrasing what was written in verse 1:1
  > **Rev 1:1** This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John,
  > **Rev 22:6** And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place. 
- Now the speaker is offstage; we cannot identify him by sight.
  - each phrase will gradual tell us it is Christ, the Lamb.
  - Jesus takes us back to the beginning of the book where Jesus' starts the visions.
    - He identifies Himself as the First and the Last
    - As the one who walks amongst the seven lampstands.
  - He identifies Himself here again:
    - "It is I, Jesus" Rev 22:16
- The first and the last, the alpha and Omega. Page 198
  - He appears and speaks personally in the first and last chapters.
    - The Beginning and "the END" of the book.
- The emphasis on God and Christ as the "END" of all things helps us understand the blessing for those who keep the word of the prophecy of this book.
  - True prophecy draws people to God.
    - Blessed are those who wash their robes through faith and faithfulness to Christ.
      - resisting evil, falsehood, and sin.
        - sins are activities that draw us away from God and the Lamb.
      - those pursuing holiness and righteousness by faith in Christ.
  - This prophecy is not to be hidden, but open and accessible for all.
    - it is to communicate to the original readers to repent, persevere and hold hope in the Grace of God and the Lamb.
    - It helps our thinking to remember this book was written specifically to the original readers.  There is no indication John expected it to survive for a hundred years, much less multiple thousands.

#### Why is Revelation still relevant to us? - Page 199
- First. Throughout history, many churches find themselves in similar cultures and governments or empires similar to the original readers.
  - culture the lures believers to slacken their beliefs and faithfulness to God.
  - Governments that oppress and/or suppress believers.
  - The seduction of wealth and power and all of its entanglements.
- Second. Revelation does not **only** speak about our relationship to our culture and government.
  - Revelation speaks **mostly** to our relationship with God.
    - God and the Lamb are present in **every** age and time.
    - We **cannot** limit this relationship to one specific time
      - this relationship exists at **all** times.
- "I am coming soon."  What does that mean?  When is *soon*? Page 197
  - "The New Testament leaves its readers to live with a tension." Page 197
  - Some passages say to watch and wait.  To always be expecting Christ's return to be just around the corner.
  - Other passages say that only God knows when that time will be, (and ,I think, gives a subtle warning about thinking you can second guess God.)
  - "Revelation's own perspective on the question is helpfully complex."
    - John assumes that Jesus "has" already come and is present among us.
      - Rev 1:12-20 declares that He walks among the churches that were the original readers of the book.
      - We all consider that Jesus is always present with us even when we wish He would turn His head and not look at us.
    - John shows that Christ 'may come in contingent and local ways.'
      - Jesus warned that we would come to a congregation if it did not repent and return to faith.  Rev 2:5,16; 3:3.
    - Finally, John shows Jesus Christ, the Lamb, returning in power to put an end to evil and gather up the redeemed.
      - This coming of Christ will put an end to the present age and usher in the New Creation.
    - Our author states that this back and forth between past, present, and future, makes it deliberately hard to pin point any time, place, or circumstance for any of the "events" to occur.
  - The phrase "the time is near" in Rev 22:10 is also just as convoluted. Page 200.
    - John confuses time with the constant spirals of punishing visions that repeat similar, yet different stacks of judgments.
      - Then the forward movement is stopped and glimpses of Heaven's Throne room are displayed.
  - "Readers are left with the assurance *that* the End will come but without knowing *when* it will come." Page 200
- **Do not tamper with the message.** Page 200
  - Whey did John put urgent emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the message?
  - What does maintaining that integrity mean?
  - Many readers have problems with the threatening, judgmental, gruesome parts of the book.
    - They all but ignore the warnings and only see the heavenly praise and glory verses.
    - They miss the earnest call to resist evil.
    - They miss the warnings about giving in
      - to oppressive government that would have them denounce their faith.
      - culture that would eat away at their faithfulness to God.
      - wealth and power that would lure them into abuses and excesses that victimize the vulnerable.
    - Their challenge is to see and take in the warnings as earnest calls to resist evil, repent, and practice faithfulness to God in all of their life.
  - Other readers have problems with the hope the book gives to all peoples.
    - they would rather the book as a weapon to keep everyone in line.
    - they are obsessed with the secrets of the scrolls, trumpets, and bowls.
    - they spend all their time trying to map out who corresponds to actual people in history or the future.
    - They quickly read past the scenes of praise and glory given to God and the Lamb.
    - they reduce Revelation to fatalism.
    - their challenge is to see the warnings as blanket calls to repentance and endurance no matter what difficulty they may encounter.

Page 201
"...the book's repeated spirals may move downward into visions of threat, but they return each time to scenes of glory in the presence of God."

"To hear the book in its integrity means hearing the promises that God and the Lamb extend to those of every tribe and language and people and nation."

> **Rev 22:17**
> The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!”
> He who hears, let him say, “Come!”
> He who is thirsty, let him come.
> He who desires, let him take the water of life freely.
