# Acts Recap - Notes

## Summary of the Early Church
<details>

Through out the book of Acts we see the early Church through many trials, and especially the Apostles, through their faith, are delivered from one bad situation after another.

We also see examples of how God did not have His Will or His Plan actualized by any conventional means.  It seem that God always accomplishes His purposes in very unexpected ways.

The Gentiles are accepted into the Church because the Holy Spirit lead Peter to go INTO a gentiles home.  In fact the Gentiles were lead by the Holy Spirit to ASK Peter to come to them.  God used a vision to tell Peter to go to the Gentiles and share the Gospel with them, baptise them, stay and eat a meal with them, and He witnessed them receiving the Holy Spirit.

It was the Gentiles receiving the Holy Spirit with results similar to what happened to the Apostles and Disciples that convinced the young church in Jerusalem that God's Mercy and Grace are truly available to all nations.

God chose one of the most ZEALOUS enemies of the church, a highly educated, extremely smart, Pharisee to be one of the main people to take His Gospel to the Gentiles.

Not only that, but Paul, with his extensive theological education, and inbred knowledge of scripture was given time and opportunity to work out how Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are in fact the fulfillment of all of Israel's hope.  Jesus fulfills God's plan of the Salvation of Israel, but is also a blessing to all nations, just as He had promised Abraham.

## The Conclusion of Acts
<details>

We have the Pauline title of Jesus:  The LORD Jesus Christ.

Peter, Paul, and other Apostles are just the vehicles of the story.  The main character throughout the stories told in The Acts of the Apostles is Jesus himself.  A character who is only physically present in the beginning of the story, but is in fact the central character through the book.

The fact that Jesus is the main character with the church as the co-star, is evident by the way the book stops; it does not end; it stops!

Paul tells the Jewish leaders in Rome the gist of his message: (from NT Wright's Acts for Everyone, Part II pg 245) "that Israel's God, the creator, the God of Abraham, had, in the Messiah, Jesus, claimed His thrown as Lord of the world, the one of whom Caesar was simply a low-grade parody."
    "If He (Jesus) is Messiah, He is the world's true King."

When Acts stops, Jesus, through His servant Paul, has marched into Rome in the company of His believers.  (the Roman Christians traveled about 100 miles south of Rome, to Three Taverns and The Appian Forum, to accompany Paul into Rome)

Just as He has done every time, God makes Himself present and know through the most unexpected, unusual, and in most cases, the most humble ways.

## The Victory of Acts
<details>

Acts stops with the Pauline title of Jesus:  The LORD Jesus Christ.  This he declares to the Jewish leaders in Rome.

One of Paul's visions was that he would in fact get to Rome and declare the Gospel in front of Caesar.  For many years Paul is anticipating, and working toward getting to Rome, and there is delay after delay.

Luke seems to structure the stories in Acts similar to how is structured his Gospel.  Just when we think there will be victory in a conventional sense, and huge disaster strikes.

In the Gospel, Jesus is killed.  How can Messiah deliver Israel if He is dead?  And yet three days later there is victory through Jesus's resurrection. The Apostles and disciples know this is revolutionary in a very unexpected way.  Not military, political revolution, but something SO much greater.

Ultimately, Jesus ascends to Heaven (in Acts) and sends the Holy Spirit as He promised.

Little do the authorities know, but God's Kingdom has declared victory right under the noses of Israel and Rome.

Similarly, in Acts, Paul is finally on his way to Rome to have his audience with Caesar, but they are caught up in a huge storm and adrift for days. The ship is ultimately destroyed.  They are shipwrecked.  They make it to shore on Malta and once there, Paul is bitten by a venomous snake and should have died.

The difference between Acts and Luke's Gospel is that we cannot equate Paul to Jesus.  Remember the hero of Acts is Jesus; Paul is just His Apostle and servant.  So Acts does not end with some kind of victory for Paul; Paul's story stops.

What happened with his audience with Ceasar?
Did he eventually make it to Spain?
Was he eventually martyred in Rome?

The victory at the end of Acts is that the Gospel of the crucified and resurrected LORD Jesus Christ was carried to Rome, the center of the world at that time.

God used the Jewish and Roman authorities to kill Jesus.
God used the Jewish authorities to arrest Paul.
God used the Roman authorities to get Paul to Rome and ultimately before Caesar.

From there, Christianity explodes to all corners of the world, and Christianity eventually conquers Rome itself.

## From Acts To Revelation
<details>

One of the ways that Revelation is interpreted throughout history is the spiritual message of the book.  One main theme that runs through Revelation is God's victory over evil.  Jesus promised that His followers would face difficult times, and Revelation gives various extreme examples of real and imagined trouble that Christians can, do, and will face.  Yet, in the end the message of the book is that those who remain faithful will live in the presence of God for eternity.

Our study of 

The book of Acts has already taken us through the real problems and troubles that the early church faced, and showed how God pulled them through every trial to eventually get the Gospel to Rome.  Acts has already shown us God caring for the faithful, and delivering them over and over again as they strive to follow Jesus.

Now in Revelation we will see much of the trials of the church both from our reality, but with a peek behind the curtain at goings on in Heaven as events unfold on Earth.
