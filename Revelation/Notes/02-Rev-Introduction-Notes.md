# Introduction to Revelation - Notes

Revelation is not a book for casual or lite reading.

The book summons to grapple with God's judgement on a world that is always seems to be in rebellion against Him.

From the introduction of Revelation (the NIV Application Commentary) by Craig Keener, "The true and living God summons us from our preoccupation with the world to recognize, in light of his ultimate plan for history, what really matters and what really does not."


## Considerations before scripture
There are MANY things we must first consider before we dive into the actual scriptures.

### Genre
Revelation consists of a combination of 3 genres, not just one.
It is apocalyptic, prophetic, and epistolary.

The Jewish and Christian extra-biblical, apocalyptic books normally date between 200 BC and 200 AD, and the genre gets its name from the Greek 'apocalypsis' which means 'revelation.'

The meaning is to reveal something that exists, but was hidden.

Revelation shares many similarities with these extra biblical apocalyptic books.
Apocalyptic:
- symbolism and visions
- angelic beings as mediators of the revelation
- bizarre imagery.
- the expectation of divine judgement
- emphasis on the Kingdom of God
- New heavens and new earth
- dualism of this age and the age to come.

The apocalyptic writings are not prophetic.
This is one of the areas where Revelation differs.
- It is prophetic (1:3, 22:7,10,18-19) and declares itself as such.
  - Rev 1:3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and who keep what is written in it; for the time is near.
  - Rev 22
    - (7) “See, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”
    - (10) And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
	- (18) I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book; (19) if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
As such:
- The author names himself, and is seemingly known to the recipients.
- It is not pessimistic about God's intervention to set the world right.
- John places himself in the world of 1st century AD along with the churches to whom he is writing.
  - Many apocalyptic writers would recast past events as futuristic predictions.
- John speaks like OT prophets concerning God's reign over the earth.
  - John considers God's Kingdom has already broken into history of his day.

The book is packaged in an epistolary framework that places it in the history of that time.
- It names the sender
- names the addressees
- Contains greetings
- Contains a doxology
- And a postscript (22:10-21)

### Authorship

1. The most accepted theory even today is that the Apostle John is the author.
2. It is also possible that the author was not the apostle, but one of his disciples.
3. There was a less popular theory that the contents were the teachings of John the Baptist, and written down and compiled by one of his disciples at a later date.
   - Recall that at the beginning of Acts 19, Paul met some Christians in Ephesus that had not yet heard of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  They had been disciples of John the Baptist, and had only received John's baptism.


### Date
There are two majorly accepted times frames.
- Nero's reign from AD 54 tp 68.
- Domitian's rule from AD 81 tp 96.

Between Nero and Domitian are
- Galba 69 - 69
- Otho Jan - Apr 69
- Aulus Vitellius July - Dec 69
- Vespasian 69 - 79  (destruction of Jerusalem.)
- Titus 79 - 81

Revelation (The NIV Applicaton Commentary) pg 34 of 523.

### Traditional Materials

John does not quote the OT, but he does make many allusions to many OT works.
- 278 versus out of the total of 404 contain allusions to OT works.
- Frequently refers to Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel.
- Also Psalms, Exedus, and Deuteronomy.
- John recasts the OT images into Christological reinterpretations.


### Leading Interpretations
There are four MAJOR interpretations that we need to think about.
Why?
These interpretations have shaped a lot of different teachings, and some are very popular in current media.  These things color and shape how each of us individually think about what we are reading in the text whether we are concious of that or not.

1. Preterist - think the events were largely fulfilled in the 1st century AD.
2. Historicist - Believe the events unfold gradually through history.
   - This was the view of many of the Reformers who equated the Papacy with the Antichrist.
3. Futurist - claims the events of Revelation outline a script that will play out in the last days.  The events in ch 4-22 have not yet been fulfilled.
4. Idealist - Does not pinpoint the images and symbolism to events in history.
   - Revelation is concerned with timeless truths about the battle between good and evil, and this continues throughout the ages.


### Outline


## The Message of Revelation

From: Revelation (The NIV Application Commentary) pg 39 of 523

Revelation addresses many issues that have not changed because human nature and God's character have remained constant.

Because the book was delivered as an entire book ... it is important that every time we read, teach, or preach any passage in Revelation, we do so in light of the themes of the entire book the passage reflects.

When we think of Revelation today, many of us think of debates on fine points of end-times events, but these details are hardly the primary message of Revelation.  ...On some matters of detail, it is possible that most of use will be surprised.  After showing how God regularly surprised his people by the way he fulfilled both Old and New Testament prophecies, isn't possible that God may fulfill some predictions in ways humans have not yet conceived?

In discussing New Testament teaching about Jesus' return, can we miss the summons to holiness in readiness for Christ's return, on of the most pervasive Second-Coming themes in the New Testament?

In the New Testament nor in early Christian confessions of faith, no end-times details appear, and have never been part of a Christian test of faith.  The only consensus was that Jesus will come again, but no details are part of any test or confession of faith.

What is Revelation's overall message?

- God is awesomely majestic.
- It proclaims Jesus's full deity.
- God is sovereign in our problems as communities and as individuals.
  - Jesus, as the sacrificial Lamb, brings ultimate and complete deliverance to those who trust in Him.
  - Ultimately, Christ's victory, our victory, is assured. Jesus is Lord, not Caesar.
  - The Hope of eternal life in God's presence far exceeds any current suffering.
- It applies OT passages about God and applies them to Jesus.
  (NIV Application Commentary pg 41)
- God's judgements usually serve notice to the world that God will avenge His people.
- God will judge, even though sin appears to run unchecked for a time.
- God does not use or rely on what the world regards as powerful.
  - God accomplishes His plans through seemingly weak and humble groups.
  - God's Kingdom contrasts the world's values.
    - The bride vs the prostitute.
    - New Jerusalem vs Babylon.
- WORSHIP leads us from grief over our sufferings to seeing them from a heavenly perspective.
  - WORSHIP leads us to realize our place with God regardless of the conditions of the world.
- Proclaiming the Gospel of Christ and being His follower can lead to persecution.
- Christ is worth dying for.
- God's plan and His church include any and all types of people from EVERY nation, class, and walk of life.
- Revelation proclaims Christ's LORDSHIP more explicitly and frequently than some parts of the NT.
- Christians confront opposition by increasing the boldness of our witness.
- We do not belong to this world, and should not allow ourselves to be seduced by its values, but remain vigilant, and resist compromise.
