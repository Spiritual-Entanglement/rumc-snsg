# Chapter 5: The Beast and The Lamb

Pages 129 - 142

## The Beast from the Land 13:11-18

"John's characterization of the power of God and powers of evil continues..." pg 129.

- Trinities in Revelation
  - Holy Trinity
    - God the Father Almighty on the throne
    - The Lamb, Christ Jesus, brings people to worship God.
    - The Spirit who speaks through the prophets
      - and ministers directly to the faithful.
  - The evil Trinity
    - Satan - the dragon
    - the beast from the sea:
      - brings people to serve Satan.
      - a perverse imitation of Christ.
        - appears to have survived a fatal wound to one of its heads.
      - its true character oppresses people into slavery serving the dragon.
    - the beast from the land: functions as a false prophet.
      - two horns similar to what a lamb might have.
        - an appearance that might foster trust at first.
      - words and deeds
        - thinly veiled, but leading to destruction.
        - that bring people to him as someone who looks out for their needs
        - ultimately they end up serving and worshiping the dragon

- The beast from the land
  - John sees this beast as a false prophet.
    > Rev 16:13 - I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;
    > Rev 19:20 - The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. 
    > Rev 20:10 - The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
    - This beast contrasts the two prophetic witnesses (who are really more than just two people, but represent the entire Church).
    - This beast has power to perform signs and wonders similar to Old Testament prophets and the two witnesses. Rev 13:13
      - Signs and wonders to not make one a prophet.
    - A __true prophet__ moves people to worship God the Father Almighty, not an evil imitation and deceiver.
  - Smoke and Mirrors
    - Rev 13:14-15.  The beast causes people to make a image of the beast from the sea.
      - People are to worship this image.
      - The beast can make it appear that the image can speak.
        - A powerful trick in John's day.
        - With today's technology it would be very easy.
    - Isaiah 44. Our author mentions this story where a persons uses part of a tree to fashion a God to worship and the other part to cook his dinner.
      > Isaiah 44:14a-17 - He plants a cypress tree, and the rain nourishes it.  <sup>15</sup>Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it and warms himself.  Yes, he burns it and bakes bread.  Yes, he makes a god and worships it; he makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.  <sup>16</sup>He burns part of it in the fire.  With part of it, he eats meat.  He roasts a roast and is satisfied.  Yes, he warms himself and says, “Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.” <sup>17</sup>The rest of it he makes into a god, even his engraved image.  He bows down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!”
    - The threat is real.  If you don't worship the image, the beast may have you killed.  Rev 13:15
  - Again, neutrality is not possible.
    - This time from the evil trinity:
      - everyone must take the seal/sign/mark of the beast from the sea.
      - if you don't you will suffer economic hardship and threats of violence and death.
      - this brings it down to everyone, rich and poor alike.
      - see last full paragraph on page 131.
  - 666 - The number of the beast; the number of a man
    - __MANY, MANY__ interpretations and theories about what or who this number points to.
      - See pages 132 - 133 for our author's complete discussion of the number 666.
    - imperfections - pg 132a. 7 is perfect, so 6 might mean IMperfect.
      - but 7 is the number of heads the beast have.
      - still 7 might mean perfect: the beasts are "perfectly" evil.
    - related idea: human arrogance - pg 132b. Humans created on the 6th day.
      - 666 could indicate total human arrogance.
    - __John__ says it is the number of a person.
      - Many ancient cultures initially used letters as numbers before there were specific symbols for numbers.
      - Again, __many, many__ ways to do this.  pg 132c-f.
      - Two crucial things to keep in mind:
        1. What might this number mean to the 7 early churches?
           - John is not writing in cryptic code.  He wants to be understood.
        2. How does the number fit the literary context?
           - John has already described the beast so the number is not new info.
           - the number 'reinforces' what John has already said.
      - Most likely to point to someone similar to Nero.
        - Nero was already dead when John wrote Revelation.
        - Nero was the Caesar to persecute Christians the most up to this point in history.
        - John wrote in Greek, but used Hebrew names for some things
          > Rev 9:11 <ins>Abaddon</ins> - They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is “Abaddon”, 
          > Rev 16:16 <ins>Armageddon</ins> - He gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew, “Armageddon”.
        - Nero Caesar would add up when using the Hebrew spelling: nron qsr
          - see author's footnote on page 133.
    - Modern fears and predictions.
      - Many look for current tyrants in their times and try all kinds of mathematical tricks to make names add up to 666.
        - this has been done all through history and continues today.
        - it is another attempt to take Revelation literally, and as a sequence of events following a strict timeline.
      - Literal or Symbolic?
        - We have already shown evidence that Revelation is using symbolic language, not literal.
          - no one expects a human tyrant or dictator to have seven heads, or ten horns, or the body of a leopard, or to look like a lamb.
        - __HOW__ do we read this symbolic language?  That is the more appropriate question.
          - are these coded predictions of figures that will appear at the end of time?
          - __OR__ are these threats that people throughout time will face until Christ's return?
    - Historical interpretations
      - Many attempts to identify a person from the first centuries who would be the specific person or group that IS the beast.
        - The assumption again, is that the descriptions in John are coded messages.
        - See page 134 middle paragraph.  (page 134c,d)
    - A way to think about it...
      - Many people and groups fit the mold, both outside of the Church as well as many misguided and corrupt Christians throughout history into our present day.
      - the fact that so many people and groups might be *the* beast indicates that we **cannot** limit the threats John warns us about to one time or place.
        - On one hand: the portrayal of the beasts is not code.  It does not help predict the end of time.  No one has been able to do that successfully yet.
        - On the other hand: the text cannot be reduced to a particular political tract against Rome alone.
          - These visions give readers of all times a way to discern the presence of evil in the world.
          - These visions call all readers, of all times, to "the endurance and faith of the saints." Rev 13:10b.

### The better questions to ask as we read Revelation
- When is there a time or place when the evil trinity (Satan and the beasts) ***NOT*** apparent?
- When is the threat to corrupt our religious beliefs and practices ***NOT*** a threat?
- When to Christians, followers of the Lamb of God, ***NOT*** experience resistance to our beliefs or pressure to give up or slacken our commitments?
- ***ALL*** generations of Christians are confronted with false worship and violence, in some time and place.
  - These warnings, and the message to persevere hold fast to our faith, apply not just to the first century Christians in the seven churches.
  - Nor do the warnings and call only apply to Christians at the end of time.

## Judgement, Blessing, and Endurance (14:1-20) pages 135 - 140

- John shows us we are in the midst of the struggle between God and evil.
  - John gives a glimpse of the outcome.
    - God will not abandon the faithful.
    - God will not allow evil to triumph.
    - **BUT** God wants to give everyone the opportunity to repent.
      - this become apparent, and is discussed, later in the chapter.

### The Redeemed on Mt Zion (14:1-5)

- Mount Zion.
  - The Lamb holds the high ground.
    - Satan and the beasts hold the land and sea: the low ground.
  - The redeemed gather here for safety and to worship God.
    - Typically refers to Jerusalem.
    - Here it refers to Heaven.
  - New Song - increased praise.
    - Only the redeemed can even learn this new song.
  - The redeemed have God's and the Lamb's mark on them.
    - They have not compromised their faith.
    - OR, I would say, if they had compromised before, they repented and stopped compromising their faith.
  - Verse 4 refers, symbolically, to those who engage in practices linked to pagan gods and the empire.
    - Elsewhere John refers to the Church, the people of God as a woman who bears many children (12:17), and a bride on her wedding day (19:7-9, 21:2, 9).
    - Keep in mind that Mary is venerated.
      - Jesus told John to consider Mary as his own mother.
    - it is very unlikely that John is speaking literally here.
  - Verse 4 also refers to the first fruits hinting that the harvest is just beginning.
    - The "144,000" in Heaven, that represents the whole church, will be joined by more believers.
- Messages of the Three Angels (14:6-13) page 137
  - The **first** angel declares the *Eternal* Gospel.
    - Worship God the creator.
    - He will not surrender His creation to the forces of evil.
    - He holds back utter devastation to give people time to repent.
  - The **second** angel declares that "*Babylon*" has fallen.
    - The fall is not described until the next cycle.
      - further evidence not to take all the events in sequential order.
    - It is a dire warning:
      - Do not place your hope and faith in earthly kingdoms.
      - They are <ins>***ALL***</ins> doomed to failure.
    - More than a code for Rome.
      - The "portrait" of Babylon encompasses kingdoms and empires from all times and places.
  - The **third** angel
    - "Issues one of the most gruesome warnings in Revelation." (14:9-11) page 137
    - Those who willingly take part in worship of the evil trinity will be punished.
    - The description of the punishment here has caused a lot of issues in and out of the Church. page 138
      - Some have used it as a weapon against those who are different from them.
        - Be careful of self-righteousness which blinds people to their own sins.
        - Rev 2:4 - those who refuse to show and respond to others with love will fall under Christ's judgement.
      - Other dismiss this judgement as too extreme and UNchristian even for God.
        - This ignores warnings of God's judgement mentioned in the Gospels.
          - Matt 13:36-43, 47-50; Luke 16:19-31
      - page 138e."Judgement is an integral part of the Christian message.
        "The vision of divine wrath is properly read as a warning.  Warnings are not given in order to make people despair of grace but to bring about change and to avert disaster."
      - page 138f. Emphasis was made by me: "John is *compelled* to write because the threat of divine judgment is real, and he is *able* to write because the hope of averting judgment is also real...In the end, the best response to the specter of judgment is *not* to explain it (judgment) away, but to heed the (first) angel's call for repentance (14:6-7) and to seek the mercy of God.
  - Working together: warnings of judgment and promises of blessings
    - The warnings disturb readers (14:9-11)
    - The promise of blessings reassures the faithful (14:13)
    - They serve the same end: persevere in the faith with patient endurance. (14:12)
- Ingathering and Judgment (14:14-20)
  - John points us to the end of the story where the final harvest takes place.
  - Some readers (from John's day until now and into the future) may think that evil is invincible or maybe really is not evil at all.
  - At the final harvest
    - one angel is depicted as swinging a sickle and gathering all the faithful to Heaven.
    - another angel is described as harvesting the grapes, representing the wicked, who are not gathered to Heaven.
  - Another warning of reward for faithful perseverance or punishment for worshiping and compromising with evil.
  - John keeps deploying different images in an effort to try to connect his message to as many people as possible.

### Lord of the Nations (15:1-4)

- The end of this cycle brings us back to the Heavenly Throne room as chapter 15 starts.
- The vision here starts with a theme of victory.
- The vision reflects back to Israel escape from Egypt.
  - the whole Church is standing by a sea.
    - this sea is glowing with fire
    - the Church has been victorious over the evil trinity.
    - just like Israel did after crossing the Red Sea, the Church sings a song in praise of God.
      - The song celebrates God as the true King of *all* the nations.
    - page 141b the "imagery transforms the story of Israel's liberation from slavery in the time of Moses, into the story of liberation through the Lamb.
- page 141f. "God does not want the nations of the world to be lured into allying themselves with the power of evil (13:7-8), but neither does he want the nations to be destroyed.  Instead, God's desire is for change..."
  - In all the previous visions of punishment and destruction, God eased the judgments so that people had time to repent.
    - Through the example of the saints and witnesses suffering, people came to repentance.
    - God's desire is not to punish.
  - page 141a - John's "repeating the visions of heavenly worship stresses that this is the future that Revelation wants for its readers.  This is where God and the Lamb want people to be."

As this cycle comes to a close the next begins...
