## In The Presence of the Living One - Rev 1: 9-20
pg 56

*From: NT. Wright Revelation for Everyone Rev 9-20*
- God making good come from bad.
  - The authorities have tried to silence John's bold preaching by exiling him to Patmos.
  - Now John seems to have more time for prayer and time to write down his vision.
    - The result is this explosive, dramatic, visionary message designed to demonstrate God's power and sovereign rule over the powers of this world.

### How can God s Kingdom sit alongside suffering and endurance?
- One point of the whole book is that Jesus won His victory by and through His suffering.

*From NIVAC*
- John sees Jesus in the midst of the seven lamp stands, indicating that Jesus is always's with His churches.
- When we read the letters to the churches we will find that:
  - 5 of the 7 are in need of correction,
  - yet Jesus is still with them
    - Jesus is still pouring out His mercy and grace to them.
  - When we see other churches in trouble, and needing correction, we must remember that they are still participants in God's Kingdom and Jesus is in their midst too. There may be things there we disagree with, but Jesus's grace and mercy still apply to them.

## Not All Readers are Alike - Rev 2:1-3:22
pg 60

*From the NIVAC*
Letter template
- To the angel of the church in a given city, write:
- Jesus says:
  - includes some part of Jesus's glorious image mentioned in verses 1:9-20.
- I know...( usually some praise about the specific church)
- But I have this against you...( some rebuke is leveled here)
- The one who hears must pay attention to what the spirit says
- Eschatological promise.
  - Eschatological - things that concern the "end times" and the coming of God's Kingdom.

### Ephesus - Rev 2:1-7
Rev 2:4 "I do, however, have one thing against you: you have abandoned the love you showed at the beginning."
-NT Wright's translation

- They have been great witnesses for Christ.
  -By the early 100's, Christian writers are highlighting the faithful witness of the Ephesian Christians..
  -In 431 one of the great church councils is held there. The 3rd ecumenical council.
- Apostles
  -They are very good and on watch for false apostles.
   - they challenge them
   - In their zeal to protect their faith, they may have grown cold and harsh.
- Love is an action: something we do
  -  Feed the hungry
  -  house the homeless
  -  help the poor
  -  it is shown through our actions.
  -  it treats others with fairness, kindness, and hospitality,

*From the NIVAC*
- First geographically
- First in other ways
  - More powerful politically than Pergamum.
  - The Imperial cult favors it more than Smyrna.
  - Large Jewish population
- See the handouts from Sue.
- Presents of false teachers everywhere
  - False apostles as well
  - Christians in Ephesus have grown in skill at discerning false teaching and heresy since Paul's day.

**LOST LOVE**
- They've lost the ideal of Christian love
- They're treatment of others outside the congregation and maybe within too.
- "For the church in Ephesus, "overcoming" or  "conquering" (2: 7) requires more than the vigilance of theological watchmen, it requires the internal unity of love."

**THREAT:**
- If they don't correct themselves their lamp stand will be removed indicating the end of that church.
  - The lamp stands might symbolize the interior of the Temple where the high priest would need candles to see.
    - The Temple in Jerusalem has a large lampstand in it.
	- The Jewish menorah has seven branches.  Here we have seven individual lamp stands.
	- The disappearance of a lamp stand would symbolize the church losing is Christian identity.

**PROMISE:**
- Their promise is to eat from the tree of life which usually indicates eternal life w/ God.
  - The symbol of the tree of life has other uses in Judaism as well as paganism.
    - Many pagan temples had gardens with trees and some trees were considered sacred.
	  - there was a tree of life in the temple of Artemis that where criminals could seek asylum from the authorities.
  - From the rest of the book of Revelation it is clear the Tree of Life is the one mentioned in Genesis in the Garden of Eden.
    - the use of it here symbolizes eternity with God.

**Summation:**
"A church where love ceases can no longer function properly as a local expression of Christ's many-membered body. This is one of the offenses for which a lamp stand can be moved from its place 2:7), through which a church can ultimately cease to exist as a church. Some churches die from lack of outreach, lack of planning for the rising generation, or lack of courtesy to visitors; some churches, like the churches in Ephesus, may risk simply killing themselves off by how they treat others."


## List of Grievances 
1. Lost Love - Ephesus lost the primary Christian love we are called to express to the World.  This is the love God has shown to us, and we naturally want to reflect back to the world.  You see this in people who have newly become Christians, or people who are starting a new church or ministry.  The church in Ephesus has been around for quite a while now, and the "new church smell" seems to have worn off.
   - 1 Cor 13:13 (NRSV)
	 "And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love."
   - 1 Cor 13 (NIV)
     "If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.

     4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

     8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

     13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

   - Significance:
     - The fist church on the list has lost love of neighbor.
	   - maybe lost love of self.  OR maybe they love self so much they cannot see others with God's love.
	   - maybe they are losing love and connection with God.  They seem to be in danger of this.
