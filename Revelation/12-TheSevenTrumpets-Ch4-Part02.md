## Chapter 4: Trumpets of Terror and Hope

**"Repentance, not destruction is what God desires"** pg 97

**Judgement Interrupted Rev 10: 1-11**

### The seventh trumpet

  - A very fearsome angel descends on the earth. 
  - It seems ready to unleash the final blow. 
  - Seven thunders roar out.
  - But then the voice from Heaven interrupts 
    - Seal up the message of the seven thunders.
  - The angel has the scroll from Rev 6:1 - 8:1 
    - The seals have been broken, so now we could read it 
    - But John is told to eat it
      - He internalizes the message
  - The sequence from Rev 1:1 is played out for us here
    - The message was passed from God, to Jesus, to an angel, to John.
  - The seventh trumpet is the words from Rev 10:6 -7 
    - "God's fundamental identity is that of Creator not destroyer" pg 104
    - The blowing of the trumpet will fulfill the mystery of God

##### PART of the mystery is the "good news,"
  - the Kingdom of the world is now the Kingdom of God.
    - Consistent with the prophets
      - Isa 2:1-4
        > 2 The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
          1 In days to come
              the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it.
          3 Many peoples shall come and say,
          “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
          4 He shall judge between the nations,
              and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
      - Mic 4:1-5
        > 1 In days to come
              the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised up above the hills.  Peoples shall stream to it,
          2 and many nations shall come and say:
          “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
          3 He shall judge between many peoples,
              and shall arbitrate between strong nations far away; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more;
          4 but they shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees,
              and no one shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.
          5 For all the peoples walk,
              each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.
      - Zech 14:16
        > 16 Then all who survive of the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the festival of booths.
##### The mystery is more about "how" God will reach the ungodly.
  - Compare Rom 16:25-26 
    > 25 Now to God, who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages 26 but is now disclosed, and through the prophetic writings is made known to all the Gentiles, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith
  - The suffering, and ultimately the resurrection and redemption of God's people is more powerful than the force of threats of destruction.
    - This becomes more apparent when we study the two witnesses later.
#### But John is told to eat the scroll
  John is to prophesy again ABOUT (not "to") many peoples, nations languages, and kings. Rev 10:11 
  - The Blood of the Lamb, saves many people and nations, not just Israel  Rev 5:9
    - The many people and nations are also represented in Heaven praising God.
    - The witness comes FROM every nation, with a message TO or FOR every nation.
    - Ultimate - even those who oppose God and oppress and persecute His church, have hope in repentance.
  - The scroll is both sweet and bitter.
    - The truth and beauty of life as Jesus' disciple is sweet.
    - Bitter is the possiblity that we could suffer as we witness to that truth. 
      - YET, the suffering of God's people plays a role in bringing the ungodly to repentance.
#### The seventh trumpet has not yet been blown pg 106
  - The vision continues with a summary of John's message
  - Rev 11 is an overture of the rest of the book.
    - Here the beast is introduce who will make war on the two witnesses who equal the whole church
#### The community of Faith, pg 107, Rev 11:12 
  - Now the people of God are to suffer, not the ungodly.
    - a shift where the punished ungodly are probably taking out their frustrations and fears on Christians.
  - How do we understand this section?
    - The first Temple was destroyed in 587 BC by the Babylonians.
    - The second Temple was destroyed in 70 AD by Rome
    - ##### Literalist believe a new Temple will be built in Jerusalem
      - This would mean that Jerusalem and the new Temple would be overrun by Gentiles for 42 months: 3.5 years.
      - Literalists also maintain this will be the first half of the seven-year tribulation before Christ's second coming.
        - Dan 9:27 is the basis for the seven-year tribulation.
          - Seven years equals two 3.5 year periods
          - or 2 × 42 months
          - or 2 × 1,260 days
        - First half of the tribulation: increasing oppression of Jerusalem
        - Second half, the Antichrist is defeated at the end.
    - ##### The symbolic view: The while community of believers is the temple
      - Symbolically: the places mentioned, stand for the whole church.
        - The original readers were hundreds of miles from Jerusalem.
          - Remember John is building a strong sense that our hope and security in men, women, rulers, nations, economies, even the physical earth is futile.
        - symbolically this is more threatening to the seven churches and ultimately to all Christians.
        - ##### We are already prepared for symbolism
          - Lamb = Christ
          - mounted bowmen = conquest
          - Christians as Temple pillars Rev 3:12
          - Seven lampstands representing the seven churches.
          - etc
        - John "measured" the temple, but the physical dimensions don't seem that important. 
          - The "measure" is to highlight and preserve true service to God.
        - Not a Temple of stone, but a community of people
          - Temples are where priests serve
          - All cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, are priests.
          - the faithful will be called the city of God,
          - A common theme in early Christian era
            - 1 Cor 3:16
              > Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?
            - 2 Cor 6:16
              > What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, “I will live in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
            - Eph 2:20
              > So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, 20 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.
            - 1 Pet 2:5
              > like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
        - The" two" witnesses are called the two lamp stands
          - Two lamp stands in the Holy of Holies. 1 Kings 7:49
            > 48 So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the Lord: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence, 49 the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, in front of the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 
          - The two witnesses shine God's truth.
          - Lamp stands symbolized the seven churches. Rev 1:20
            > As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
        - Three-and-a-half years as symbolic
          - Symbolic time based around Dan 7:25; 9:27; 12:7
            > 7:25 - He shall speak words against the Most High, shall wear out the holy ones of the Most High, and shall attempt to change the sacred seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his power for a time, two times, and half a time.
            > 9:27 - He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make sacrifice and offering cease; and in their place shall be an abomination that desolates, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator.”
            > 12:7 - The man clothed in linen, who was upstream, raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven. And I heard him swear by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, two times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these things would be accomplished.
          - This specific length of time, 3.5 years, is also symbolic
          - Time is not always literal
            - Allies of the beast get power for '1" hour.
              > Rev 17:12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.
          - Squence is off
            - Rev 11:1-2 temple threatened 3.5 years
            - Rev 12:6,14 The "woman" (representing the whole church) flees to the wilderness to escape Satan
              > 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days.
              > 14 But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.
            - Rev 13:5 the beast oppresses the saints for 3.5 years.
              > The beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.
            - they add up to more than the seven years of the tribulation if you put them end-to-end.
              - these time periods have to overlap. They cannot be sequential
          - The time period of 3.5 years can mean a limited time of affliction
            - 1 Kings 18:1 Elijah calls a drought that lasts a little over 3 years.
              > fter many days the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year of the drought,[a] saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab; I will send rain on the earth.”
              - Jewish tradition calls it 3.5 years Luke 4:25, James 5:17
                >  Luke 4:25 - But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land; 
                > James 5:17 - Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.
            - shift from 3.5 years to 3.5 days
              - The entire world is looking at the two witness's bodies, dead in the street. Rev 11:9,11
                > 9 For three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb;
                > 11 But after the three and a half days, the breath[a] of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and those who saw them were terrified.
                -  to deny burial shows great disrespect.
            - 3.5 years symbolizes a time of affliction and/or oppression
              - we are cautioned against taking the inconsistent use of time periods as literal.

### Summary. pg 109
  - The Temple represents the whole church
  - The inner sanctuary represents true worshippers
  - The outer court is Christians who compromise their faith, incorporating other religious rites and beliefs
    - This directly addresses the situations the seven churches are facing
    - John is told to measure out the confines of true worship, and to show that God is watching and concerned, and will ultimately recieve all those washed in the blood of the Lamb to Himself in Heaven.
