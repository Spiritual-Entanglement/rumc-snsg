        - Catholic: she is Mary
          - Mary is the mother of the whole Church, not just of Christ.
          - She is our mother as well, by proxy.
      - The child is not the emperor

        - Royalty. The Queen of Heaven.
      - She is pregnant and soon to go into labor.
      - She is sheltered for 1260 days after giving birth.
        - Again, this is 3.5 years, or 42 months.
          - A time period indicating the need to endure some oppression or hardship.
        - Is this the book of Acts? 
          - the little church hiding in Jerusalem that eventually takes over Rome?
    - The child-Jesus
      - The Messiah from Psalm 2.
        - The rod is a threat to those opposed to God.
        - He will rule all peoples and nations not just Israel.
        - He will be a "shepherd" to the faithful.
    - The dragon
      - Grotesque serpent
        - huge, powerful tail
          - power and size to blackout huge sections of sky.
        - seven heads
        - ten horns
      - Seven diadems on its head
        - symbolize trying to rule and control all of creation, 
          - Grabbing power.
        - hatred of the woman and child
          - The woman already wears a bigger, more valuable crown than him.
          - The child is destine to rule over all nations.
          - The dragon must destroy them.
    - John's Expectations of his readers:
      - John expects all readers to reject the dragon
      - We are expected to side with the woman and her infant son.
      - John assumes his readers are familiar with Jesus 'story.
        - Straight from birth to enthronement.
        - The saving power of Christ's blood indicates
          - assumed knowledge of Jesus' earthly ministry
          - His death and resurrection.
        - The dragon threatened and eventually kills Jesus
          - Christ's death was not the victory the beast, Satan, hoped for.
          - Christ's death becomes the defeat of evil.
          - Does this indicate that even Satan and his demons do not fully understand God?
            - We assume angels, and Satan was an angel once, have more knowledge of God. Especially His power and holiness.
            - How can Satan even assume his plans would work to become or replace God?

- Thinking about just this section of the book and all that we have read so far:
  - Does this section help you make sense of evil in the world today?
  - Does it give any new perspectives (bigger picture) about events in the world?
  - Does it strengthen or weaken your relationship with God?
