    -all creation seems to be in distress.
     - It seems all of God's creation might be destroyed.

    - Similar to the Lamb in Rev 5:1-14
    - page 80 in our book.
    - John HEARS the 144,000
    - John SEES the multitude of faithful

- What should modern people expect from chapters 6 & 7?
  - most try to line up the seals with news stories.
  - many expect these events to all happen in order.
  - many try to line up the opening of the seals to specific events in history
    - as we have seen this always fail miserably.

    "These visions stand for larger realities"

  - Conquests, violence, economic collapse, and death from all manner of natural disasters, has been happening throughout human history.
    - Methodists, among others, do not believe that God sends specific punishments down on individuals or communities of people.
        - Disasters happen as part of the dynamic, ever changing cycle of nature.
        - People have free will, and some people choose to act in an evil manner.
  - "Prediction" is not the right word to describe the horrible events that unfold on Earth throughout Revelation.  They do fall neatly into any timeline of history.

    "These visions stand for larger realities"

- Revelation chapter 6
  - the purpose of these visions is to awaken
    - uneasiness in its readers.
    - to shatter the illusion that people can find TRUE peace and security
      - in the borders of a nation or Empire
      - in the man-made economies
      - or in our personal health
  - the visions are very meaningful to people of John's time and Christians in and around the seven churches
    - they WARN Christians:
      - DO NOT take shelter or comfort from 
        - human institutions, customs, economies, governments, or mighty and powerful people or rulers.
    - all of these are vulnerable to dramatic failure
    - "these visions relentlessly undercut human pretensions." pg 85
    - If this is true, human structures of power WILL fail, then "who is able to stand?"
      - if you are asking this question, you are ready for the seals of the scroll to be opened.

1. The first seal
   - The bowman on a white horse
     - Given a crown like a king or ruler
     - allowed to conquer
   - conquest from outside the Roman Empire is a lesser threat in John's time
     - Rome was the conqueror.
     - but the Roman Empire stopped expansion by Parthian bowmen.
   - The bowman represents security threats from outside society.
     - The Parthians remind Rome that human governments and empires are vulnerable to being conquered by outside forces.
     - Do not compromise your faith to placate human powers and governments.  They will all eventually fail.

2. The second seal
   - swordsman on a red horse. Blood?
   - Represents security threats from inside society
   - he is given the sword he rides with.
   - he is allow to take peace away from the people so they turn to violence against one another.
   - Rome was pushing the idea of "Roman Peace."
     - they wanted to sell the idea that ROME was providing this peace for you.
     - however, they use conquest and violence to maintain their peace
       - they will quell ideas or opposition to the idea that peace comes from something or someone other then Rome itself.
   - don't be lulled into a complacent faith
     - Peace can be taken from us at any time, often from within our own communities.

3. The third seal
   - the rider on a black horse
   - holds merchants scales
   - a" voice" from among the creatures announce failure of systems of economy,
     - luxuries, that cannot sustain you, are affordable to most everyone.
     - yet families cannot afford basic life necessities.
   -  don't put your faith in prosperity which can fail suddenly and drastically.
      - Rome made many material things possible from other countries
        - none of it could be guaranteed
        - crops fail, ships sink, farmland is taken over by another empire.
      - human economies do and will fail.

4. The fourth seal
   - a rider comes forth named Death
   - rides a sickly green horse
   - He is allowed to kill one fourth of the people by violence, disease, and all manner of natural causes.
   - Hades, the realm of the dead, follows him
     - Greek -> Hades. Hebrew -> Sheol
     - ravenously hungry


Page 89: Where is God in all of this?
- obviously God is allowing it.
- the horsemen are given the authority to do these things
  - only after the seal is broken
  - only after one of the creatures summons them.
- No explanation of why bad things happen is given in Revelation
- We know God and the Lamb will judge humanity
- we are reminded that God is not human
  - we see that in the thrown room of Heaven.
  - God does not think or reason as a human
  - God will NOT control human behavior
  - God will allow humans to act as they choose.
  - we know that Satan and human sin can cause unimaginably horrible acts.
    - it is obvious that the World is the realm where Satan and human sin are allowed to wreak havoc if they so wish.
    - humanity will be judged for these things
- these visions in ch 6 are calling all people to repentance and faith
  - the visions give the faithful confidence that
    - only God will see them through
    - and their ultimate end is with God in Heaven.
  - God does not owe us an explanation.
    - Back in the beginning of chapter 4, the description of God highlights the mystery that is divinity.
    - there is a difference between divine and human.

5. The fifth seal
   - the martyrs who have already killed in John's time, are there in Heaven
   - they have a special place of shelter under God's altar
     - their death had purpose in furthering God's will
     - they are important to God and given white robes
     - the robes represent purity and wholeness
       - not earned
       - BOUGHT by the sacrifice of the Lamb.
   - the vision is designed to get readers to identify and side with the martyrs.
     - there is no middle ground.
     - those who put faith in anything other than God will eventually be disturbed by the judgement to come
     - still more martyrs to come
     - the martyrs must wait a while longer for justice.
       - yet God will get justice for them
   - Only in Rev 11, is an example given of how people come to repentance and faith through a martyr's suffering.
     - again, God does not owe us an explanation.


6. The sixth seal
   - in the end even creation will not shelter humanity,
     - Isa 34: 4, Joel 2:30 -31, Amos 8.9
   - blending into the pagan beliefs of society will not shelter you, or provide security
     - The pagan beliefs have no influence on the behavior of nature.
     - When the judgement comes, nature will react to God's Will
   - In the end, even the rich and powerful will face the same fate as the weak and lowly,
     - All will seek shelter together no matter their standing in society.

Ch 7 The 144,000& The Great Multitude
- In chapter four an angel halted the chorus to ask who was worthy to open the scroll
- Now, an angel halts the destruction
  - He has the seal of God
  - He calls to four other angels who have the authority to control the "four winds" to halt the destruction taking place on Earth.
- Again John hears one thing but sees something new
  - John hears the number of those whose are given God's seal on their foreheads.
  - He is hearing the Old Testament promise of God to save and redeem Israel
    - Like the description of the New Jerusalem as being 12,000 stadia on each side
      - 12,000 is a number of wholeness
    - 12,000 from each of the twelve tribes of Judah
      - 144,000 in total
    - complete and utter wholeness of God's promise
- BUT, John sees a group that cannot be counted
  - from all nations and peoples 7: 9-17
  - yet it fulfills God's promise to preserve Israel 7:4-8
- NOW the chorus starts again

- The cascade of threats gives way to the praises of God continuing.
  - One of the elders describes to John what is taking place
  - He describes the uncountable group of people as those who have remained faithful and had their sins washed away by the Blood of the Lamb.
- Three prophecies are highlighted
  - Ezek 37: 27
  - Isa 4 9:10
  - Isa 25: 8
- The faithful have new life because of the sacrifice of the Lamb.
  - they held to confidence that God would be true to the messages and promises given through the Prophets of Israel, and the Messiah, Jesus the Christ.

## Cycle Two comes to an end, and Cycle Three begins.
Revelation 8:1
  - the seventh seal is opened
  - utter, awed silence!
