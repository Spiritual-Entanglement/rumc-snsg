Revelation by Craig R. Koester
pg 56 The Presence of the Living One 1: 9-20
• Intro by relationship not authority
• Patmos
1- banished because  of his preaching
  -superstition, magic, and astrology
  -preaching threatened socail order
2) 119 affliction t endurance
  -Patmos NOT a prison
  -Greek village w/ harbor
  -John would live in the town
• Vision 1:10
  -readers would accept genuine religious experience behind the book.
  -lots of visions in scripture and early writings
* BUT again Rev is different spiritual activity is connected to the spirit of God and the words of Christ
the testimony of Jesus
* SAW a divine figure hard to describe
  " as" and" like
  uses language from Daniel
  describes a glorified Christ
• first and last= Alpha and Omega
  -startling as Christ declares He IS God.
  -OT worship NO others!
The lamb is seated on the throne WITH God Christ shares: power, rule, story,
being of the One God-THE creator.

• Rev" confronts" the reader w/ the presence of
  - a living divine being
• the Lit structure
  -Starts w/ a person NOT an event
+ He crucified and risen Christ
  -Ends in the presence of the throne of God and the Lamb. + expected response:" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus" 22:20
• Initial Vision
  • of a living, divine being: the glorified Christ
  • a person not an event
  • a present reality
  • not detected by the senses
  • the. churches are not alone
Christ is present w/ them even if they cannot sense Him
ensuring
  + reassuring to those who want to follow Jesus 
  + unsettling to those who would rather avoid Him
 -He is Savior and Judge

pg 60 Not all Readers are Alike (211-3122)
• We" hear" Rev message diff based on our situation
  -Denounces evil and injustice
  -Calls for resistance to oppression
• Diversity of the first readers
  1 Christians threatened by society
  2 Churches w/ internal conflicts and accommodating imperial culture
  3 Christians who were comfortable and complacent + not helping those less fortunate and/or oppressed.

• Each congregation is addressed publicly,
• Each has their commitments to Christ threatened
  -either by erosion of their faith by lack of diligence
  -or blatant persecution and oppresio.nl#th.-
• Each address follows a pattern

pg 60-Address from Christ.
  -Words of rebuke and encouragement
  -Summons to listen
  -promise to the conqueror

• write to the" angel" of each church
  -unlikely to be an actual person in each church, be elsewhere in the book angels are heavenly beings
  -each church has a heavenly rep
  -yet the messages address the members directly

the vision
• Each message uses some part of earlier of Christ.
  -Consider your situation and your church's situation in relationship to Christ
    -NOT to the world
	Ex:      The world view  |  In relation to Christ
	-------------------------|-----------------------
	Smyrna        Poor       |        Rich
  	Laodicea      Rich       |        Poor

• End of each message "depicts the faithful as "conquerors""
  pg 61 - " It is the conquest of faithful endurance to which the readers are called."
  -Suggests Christians are in a struggle to remain faithful.
  -Conquest in Rev happens in two different ways
    1) Violence-the horseman& beast: oppression, war, killing
    2) victory of faith
	  -Christ the Lamb and His followers conquer "evil" by faithful "suffering" and endurance,
