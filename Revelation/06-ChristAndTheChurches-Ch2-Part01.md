## Introduction Rev 1:1-3
The true title of the book is: "The Revelation of Jesus Christ" (NIVAC)
This part sets the stage for the rest of the book. (NIVAC)

- "Revelation is a drama in two acts"
  - Act I is Rev 1-11
  - It starts as a prophetic announcement.
  - Quickly changes genre to an epistle to the churches.
  - Takes us into apocalyptic visions afterward.

- The first cycle of visions concern the seven churches in Asia Minor.
  - Many read the messages to the churches as separate from what happens in chapters 4-22
  - These messages are very important to the rest of the book.
    - They set the context of everything that comes later.
  - They set the stage for the visions that come later.
  - They are to be kept in mind as the later visions are described.


## Revelation - Prophecy - Letter: Rev 1:1-8
"The Revelation of Jesus Christ"

This book, this message is declared from the very start as coming from God
- through Jesus, who has been authorized to share it.
- through an angel -> through John -> to the Church

Revelation - What does it mean to "READ" this revelation?
- It was "shown", "signified" to John.
- He now has to describe what he saw.
- Some think the coming visions are coded messages.
  - This is implausible.
  - People from the era would be able to tell who or what was described by many of the visions.
    - The Lamb obviously 'signifies' Christ
    - The beast with 7 heads is Rome which is built on seven hills.
  - Religious symbols normally have several meanings.
    - They invite us to ongoing reflection instead of just giving information.
	- They illicit emotion and affect our will to take a position about something.
	- Example 1: The Lamb - obviously Christ.
	  - The image 'signifies' a range of associations about Christ that help us understand Christ's significance.
	    - sacrifice and atonement.
		- Passover and liberation.
		- purity and innocence.
	  - It illicits sympathy even before critical thought is engaged.
	- Example 2: the beast
	  - quickly envokes revulsion and opposition.
	  - reveals the true ugliness and danger associated with it.
	- These symbols are designed, 'signified,' to strengthen our commitment to Christ and the Gospel.

Prophecy - many meanings
- Seen as prediction of the future.
- Seen as a particular kind of bold preaching normally calling people to account for their beliefs and actions.
  - Fire and brimstone.
- Revelation has some hints of both.
  - However, in Revelation prophecy is depicted at a very special kind of divine communication; not preaching.
    - visions came by the power of God's Spirit.
	- The Spirit communicated directly through His words.
	- The words are that of God and Christ.
	  - they are in first person singular.
  - Many in the seven churches were considered 'prophets': people filled with the Spirit - very devout.
    - they probably preached very powerful messages or had very quiet but profound insights. 
  - Messages of encouragement, promises, condemnation of sin, calls for repentance,
    - threats will come about if there is no repentance.
- The TEST of Prophecy pg 49 - last paragraph
  - Does the message give by a prophet "promote faithfulness to God"?
    - True prophet's message is a witness to Christ and the Gospel.
	- True prophet's function is calling people to repentance.
  - False prophets have a message that lead people away from God
    - I would add, also causes us to NOT act in a loving way God and neighbor.
	- False prophets are condemned for luring people into false worship,
      - NOT for incorrect predictions.
  - Discerning prophets
    - A problem in all times.
	- The prophet's message will be "consistent with the community's confession of faith in Christ (1 John 4:2-3)". pg 50
- Keeping the prophecy
  - difference between understanding and actual lifestyle commitments
  - keeping, in this context, "is associated with repentance, and a manner of life that is consistent with Christ" teachings.
    - obedience to God.
	- refusal to deny your relationship with God.

The Time is "Near" - (NIVAC)
Application:
Verse 3 ends with "...for the time is near."
This is one of the problematic verses that has caused much speculation and turmoil related to Christ's return.

Whatever John meant originally, there are some perspectives that are helpful and promote faithfulness to God.
- Jesus' coming is imminent.
  - it intrudes on our life of preoccupation about earthly temporal matters.
  - it is a promise to the broken and those who follow Christ willingly.
  - it is a warning and threat to those who reject God through actions and words.
- Jesus' return will be at an unexpected time.
  - Christians are urged to remain faithful and ready.
  - Christians should live every moment as if Jesus is returning in the next second.
- The unpredictability of Christ's return should halt us from trying to predict or put deadlines on God.
  - This causes the problems we have seen with trying to read Revelation as a script to be played out in order based on some precursory events.
  - Many examples we have already seen, and the NIVAC listed many, many more we have not talked about.

---
Letter - An epistle.
- This element starts about verse 4.
- Common elements
  - Sender
    - Uncommon to apocalyptic genre, John identifies himself, and they know who he is.
	  - still some debate about which John might be the real author.
	- He identifies as a fellow servant of God.  He does not claim a position of authority.
	- He does not attribute the message of Revelation to himself or any special merit, abilities, position, or authority of his own.
  - Recipients
    - To seven specific churches in Asia Minor.
      - Seven usually represents God as well as completeness or wholeness.
	  - Asia Minor
		- Christianity was spreading rapidly (NIVAC)
		  - Some area officials complained to their superiors that the pagan temples were seeing less and less worshipers. (NIVAC)
	  - These seven churches are stragicly located to reach out to other areas of the Roman Empire. (NIVAC)
	  - Acts 19:31 ("officials of the province") that Asiarchs, church leadership, met yearly in a cycle of these cities. (NIVAC)
	  - John probably does not have enough material or secretaries to dictate a book to each church. (NIVAC)
    - To the church as a whole, as we can see ourselves in any one or more of those specific churches.
	  - Some use this as an excuse to interpret the seven churches are merely symbolic. (NIVAC)
	    - It is clear from the writing John wrote to seven literal communities of believers. (NIVAC)
		  - We can extrapolate some meanings, but it does not mean that was John's intention. (NIVAC)
	    - The order of the churches addressed followed the order a messenger would come to those cities if he was traveling from the island of Patmos. (NIVAC)
	  - Some suggest the seven churches represent seven periods or ages of church history. (NIVAC)
	    - If this is so, only the last age, and expect the immenent return of Christ. (NIVAC)
  - Greetings
    - John's knowledge of Greek.
	  - much speculation about John's knowledge and use of Greek
	- Christ introduced as the faithful witness.
	  - "Grace and Peace" is a common greeting in Jewish letters. Christians added Jesus to it. (NIVAC)
	  - He has credibility to summon other to be faithful witnesses in all circumstances.
	  - Christ demonstrated faithfulness in His death, resurrection, and lordship.
	  - Assures us that death is not the End
	  - John calls all Christians to maintain allegiance to Christ.
	    - do not submit to lesser, earthly authorities.
	- Two perspectives of Christ's death and reign.
	  1. Communal worship of the Glory of God in Christ.
	     - echos on earth the worship in Heaven.
	  2. Warning for those who reject God in Christ.
	     - they will recognize Him and regret their decisions.
	  - John uses paraphrases of Old Testament scriptures.  pg 55.

THE VOICE of GOD - pg 56
"In (Rev) 1:8 the voice of God speaks directly.
- This only happens twice in Revelation.  v1:8 and 21:5-8
- God and Christ are the beginning and the end.
  - Revelation starts and ends with God and Christ.
  - They are the focus of the book, of the message.
  - "the visions move from God and Christ to God and Christ."

---
(NIVAC)
Relevance - God is in charge and bigger than us.
- John wrote to seven strategic churches with the idea that the message would spread from there to other christian communities.
  - We need to think strategically about ministry and missions.
- Christianity outlasted the Roman Empire.
- Christianity has flourished in various place throughout the world over time.
  - dying in some areas while growing in others.
  - The 'lampstand' representing the churches can be moved.
    - if one church loses it zeal and mission for Christ, God will raise up another someplace else.
- More important is that God assures His people of help in their troubles and His sharing in our suffering.
  - "Suffering Christians,...,need reminder of God's great compassion for them; sometimes when we suffer we do not feel as if the sovereign God loves us, unless we can recognize His sharing our suffering in the cross.  The assurance of Jesus's love (1:5) goes deeper than mere worlds.... the New Testament portrays Christ's love for us as intimately bound up with His sacrifice for us. (1:5; Rom 5:5-9) ... my deepest assurance of God's love has been to look at the cross and remember that God Himself has shared my pain with me."
(NIVAC)
