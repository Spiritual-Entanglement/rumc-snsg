# Chapter 6: The Harlot and the Bride - Cycle 5

Part 1: Pages 143 - 151

## Summary of Cycle Five - Rev 15-19

- The fifth cycle starts as the fourth comes to a close.
- John warns in Rev 15:1 the end is not yet come.
  - There is more to come to give unbelievers time to repent.
- Song of praise starts the cycle as normal. Rev 15:2-44
  - All of heaven standing by a sea of glass, glowing with fire.
  - seem to be playing harp-like instruments.
  - All who persevered and held out against
    - the beast/false prophet,
    - the idolatrous image of the beast from sea.
      - An opposite of Christ in the evil trinity.
    - the number of beast.
  - They sing a song of praise like Israel did after crossing the Red Sea.
    - The song is attributed to both Moses and the Lamb.
- Similarly, the plagues to come are like those inflicted on Egypt. Rev 16
  - to liberate the faithful from the tyranny of the Dragon - Satan.
  - Again, the purpose is for the ungodly to repent.
- The Harlot: a new leader of evil is introduced. Rev 17
  - She seems elegant and glorious from a distance.
    - Beautifully dressed and elegant jewelry.
    - Drinking from a golden cup.
  - Reality shows her decadence and depravity.
    - She is riding one of the seven-headed beasts
    - She drinks the results of sin mixed with the blood of saints and martyrs.
  - Evil turns in on itself
    - the beast she is riding turns on her and destroys her in a gruesome manner.
      - it is graphic and shocking!
- An angel explains the symbolism of the Harlot and the beast to John.
  - She symbolizes the example city of Babylon and all its evil and depravity.
- Babylon is mourned by the ungodly Rev 18
  - Babylon Falls
  - Warning to escape
  - Woe to Babylon and those who trusted in her/it.
  - Babylon is doomed.
- Rejoicing in God's victory over Babylon and the beast. Rev 19.
  - Heaven rejoices at the end of Babylon
  - The beast is defeated.
  - the Lord God Almighty reigns.

### Lord of the Nations - Rev 15:1-4
- Repeat from Unit 16
  - The end of this cycle brings us back to the Heavenly Throne room as chapter 15 starts.
  - The vision here starts with a theme of victory.
  - The vision reflects back to Israel escape from Egypt.
    - the whole Church is standing by a sea.
      - this sea is glowing with fire
      - the Church has been victorious over the evil trinity.
      - just like Israel did after crossing the Red Sea, the Church sings a song in praise of God.
        - The song celebrates God as the true King of *all* the nations.
      - page 141b it is the story of liberation through the Lamb.
  - God's desire is repentance
    - Through the example of the saints and witnesses suffering, people came to repentance.
    - God's desire is not to punish.
    - page 141a - John's "repeating the visions of heavenly worship stresses that this is the future that Revelation wants for its readers.  This is where God and the Lamb want people to be."

## The Seven Bowls of Wrath - Rev 15:5-16:21

### Tent of Witness in Heaven - Rev 15:5-8


- John now sees the tabernacle.
  - Some translations suggest it is like the tent sanctuary Moses saw on Mt Sinai. Exod 25:9.
- Seven angels, dressed like priests, exit the tabernacle.
  - They have the plagues with them already.
  - One of the four creatures brings them seven golden bowls full of God's wrath.
    - Previously, the four creatures held golden bowls with incense. Rev 5:8.
      - The smoke from the incense rose **up** with the prayers of the saints and martyrs.
    - Now the action is reversed and the contents of the bowls, the wrath, will be poured out on the earth.
- The temple becomes so full of smoke that no one can enter.
  - this condition will last until all the plagues have been poured out.
  - this insures the angels cannot turn back until their task is complete.
  - The smoke is the same indication of God's presence filling the temple.
    - Exod 40:34-38 - God's presence as smoke in the original tent sanctuary.
    - 1 Kings 8:10-11 - dedication of the first temple in Jerusalem built by Solomon.
  - It is more ominous than joyous.  It has a serious connotation.

### Seven Bowls of Wrath - Rev 16:1-21

#### Overview
- A stylized pattern like the trumpets.
  - First four trumpets and bowls affect land, sea, inland water, and the sun.
  - Fifth trumpet and bowl affect the beast.
  - The sixth bring hostile armies massing at the Euphrates River.
- Repetition.
  - Similar messages and warnings in different ways.
  - Not linear events: scrolls, then trumpets, then bowls.
    - they represent large picture disasters affecting the earth and humanity.
  - Why repeat the visions?
    - The message God want to convey is important and serious.
      - Repent.
      - Make or renew your commitment to God.
      - Resist evil and persevere through oppression and injustice.
      - Your faith is important on so many levels.
    - John is putting together several ways to illustrate how evil infiltrates and erodes our lives and souls, and the result of being complacent, inattentive, and careless.
      - All the repetitions consider whether people will repent of not.

#### The 1<sup>st</sup> Angel, the 1<sup>st</sup> Bowl
- The bowl is poured out on the land.
- Affects those with the mark of the beast.
  - The mark becomes infected, and other parts of the body.
  - God does not kill them; they have time to repent.
    - The beasts killed those who would not bow down.
    - God spares their lives.
#### The 2<sup>nd</sup> Angel, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Bowl
- The bowl is poured out on the sea.
- The sea turns to blood.
  - Everything in the sea dies.
  - Revelation does not explain *why* God would allow this.
    - Mystery.  He does not owe us an explanation.  Job.
  - Instead Revelation asks: pg 147
    - "Why do the ungodly survive?"
    - "Why have God's judgements not annihilated those who oppress the faithful?
  - This would again cause severe hardship on humanity which live partially on the sea.
    - The evil in the world has shed a lot of blood, and now the sea is full of it.
- God is not indifferent to evil, but is granting time to repent.
#### The 3<sup>rd</sup> Angel, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Bowl
- The bowl is poured out on all the fresh water sources.
  - Again: the evil in the world has shed a lot of blood, and now the sea is full of it.
    - Verses 16:5-7 hears the angel in charge of the waters say the punishment is justified, and the altar agrees.
    - Strangely we see restraint on God's part: the punishment is not equal to the crime.
      - God spares the lives of the ungodly who have killed the faithful.
      - this does not fit Old Testament "life for a life" (Exod 21:23) justice.
    - While the punishment is harsh, there is some compassion giving people time to repent.
#### The 4<sup>th</sup> Angel, the 4<sup>th</sup> Bowl
- The bowl is poured out on the sun.
  - Instead of going dark, the heat from the sun intensifies.
- The truly ungodly refuse to repent.
  - They are not silent, but blaspheme God.
- Again, there is no middles ground; you must choose God or evil.
  - Some faithful are pressured to renounce their faith.
    - The visions and warning illustrate that compromising with the dragon or the beast puts one in direct conflict with God.
#### The 5<sup>th</sup> Angel, the 5<sup>th</sup> Bowl
- The bowl is poured out on the throne of the beast.
  - Instead of destroying the beast's kingdom, it is plunged into darkness.
    - Similar to Egypt.
  - If you are not repentant, then you are truly aligned with the beast.
    - God is not preventing anyone from repenting by destroying them before they have the chance.
#### The 6<sup>th</sup> Angel, the 6<sup>th</sup> Bowl, page 149
- The bowl is poured out on the Euphrates River.
  - The water dries up allowing armies from the East full access to attack.
  - Many human kingdoms were attacked through the centuries by kingdoms on the other side of the Euphrates.
    - It represents threats to society and order through many different times.
- Now the Dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the land (the false prophet) start taking direct action.
  - Frog-like creatures come out of their mouths.
    - Frogs are unclean and not to be put in the mouth.
    - These frogs gathers up the other kings from around the world at Armageddon to prepare for war.

##### Armageddon - Rev 16:16, page 150
- Armageddon is the site where the war on the "great day of God the Almighty" is to take place.
  - Armageddon is only named here in Rev 16:16.
  - Armageddon seems to be fashioned from two Hebrew words.
    - *Har* meaning mountain.
    - *Megiddo* a place in northern Israel that is on a plain, not on a mountain.
  - The battle is not described until Rev 19:11-21.
- The name has been given many meanings in popular culture, and like much of Revelation is many times interpreted by secular and even religious society without context.
- Our author asks two questions now about the significance of the name Armageddon. 
  1. "Is the name literal or symbolic?" page 150
     - See page 150 for the author's full argument.
     - John uses Hebrew names for those people or place opposed to God.
       - Other Hebrew names he has used show themselves to be very symbolic.
       - It makes sense to follow the pattern, and say the Armageddon is also used symbolically.
  2. "What does the name signify?" page 150.
     - Megiddo is used in the Old Testament as a place name for battles where Israel defeats its enemies.
     - We can extend that to mean that the massing armies the demon "frogs" have gathered will be defeated.
     - I think this symbolic nature of the name is lost and unknown in the average church.  Most Christians today to not know about this association.
       - This goes back to what we said in earlier sessions that the father we get from the time when Revelation was written, the harder it is to understand.
       - John used a lot of language and common cultural elements that would have been know to those in the seven churches.
         - It is not code.

#### The 7<sup>th</sup> Angel, the 7<sup>th</sup> Bowl, page 151
- The bowl is poured out into the air.
- A **loud** voice comes from the temple: **"IT IS DONE!"**
- All manner of disastrous weather erupts.
- Babylon the Great, the city that symbolically represents Rome and by extension other centers of corrupt, evil empires and governments...
  - Previously, made humanity drink the wrath of its sin.
  - Now God give *IT* the wrath of His fury to drink.
    - A massive earthquake strikes. The biggest ever.
      - The city is torn apart and society and government is thrown into chaos.
      - mountains are leveled.
      - islands disappear.
    - Giant hailstones fall from the sky.
- The last verse focuses on peoples refusal to repent.
  - John will look into this by using Babylon in the next scene.
  - Again, we are out of sequence.
    - Babylon was just broken up by earthquake, but John will describe a beautiful, wealthy city in Rev 17, and other reasons for it downfall in Rev 18.
    - Further proof the events are not sequential and to be taken symbolically.
