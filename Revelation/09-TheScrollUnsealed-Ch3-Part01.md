### Unit 9 - The Scroll Unsealed - Cycle Two - Part 01
FROM: Revelation & the End of All Things by Craig R. Koester
Chapter 3,  Romans 4-7
Questions for chapter 3 are on page 203 if you are interested.

## Chapter 2 ends after the messages to the 7 churches.
We are left with the image of Jesus standing at the door of the church at Laodicea, the door of each of our hearts.

- Ch 2 pg 73-The characterization of these churches provides context for the rest of the book.
Ultimately Christians are faced with 3 big-picture problems in the world at large:
1. Persecution
2. Assimilation
3. Complacency-that arises from prosperity and lack of persecution.

How can the scary scenes to come help to
1. Strengthen the persecuted?
2. Bring back to faithfulness the assimilated?
3. Awaken the complacent?

To mix in St Paul: how can the scenes to come help Christians to renew their Faith, Hope, and Love?

The promises made at the end of each of the messages are not lost in rest of the scenes of the book, but come to fruition in the New Jerusalem.
- Ephesus:
  - eating from the tree of life
- Pergamum:
  - given some of the hidden manna
  - given a white stone with a new name that indicates sharing in Christ's victory.
- Thyatra:
  - Sharing in Christ's rule over the nations
  - they will "receive" the morning star.
  - they will be with Christ.
- Smyra:
  - not harmed by the" second" death
- Philadelphia
  - they will be pillars of the new Temple
  - and bear the name of the New Jerusalem.
- Sardis:
  - their names will remain in the Book of Life
  - Christ will confess their names before God.
- Laodicea:
  - they will have the fellowship and communion of God
  - the Heaven/banquet.
  - they will sit with Christ on His throne


## The Second Cycle Begins
**A dramatic transition:**
- Before the conclusion of the first cycle the second cycle begins
- The **HEART** of the Book of Revelation.
- The **CENTRAL** theme of the book

### The Voice 1:10, 4 1
- this is the same voice that opened the vision to the churches.
- The voice of the glorified Christ Jesus.
- Christ stands at the closed doors of our hearts
- John stands before the already opened door of Heaven.

### Chapters 4-5
- transport us right in to the throne room of Heaven
- focus on God the Creator and Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God.
- do not rush through chapters 4 and 5.
  - Most people real fast through these chapters to get to the 7 seals.
  - the train wreck starts in chapter 6.

#### What defines a cycle?
- A narrative that begins and ends in God's presence.

#### Synopsis of the 2nd cycle
- the 4 living creatures, the 24 elders, and the angels sing praises to God. Ch 4
- the Lamb of God is present and receives the scroll with 7 seals. Ch 5
- the first 6 seals are opened. Ch 6
- the 7th seal is opened. Ch 7
  - who can stand?
  - The first martyr, who join the chorus of praise SILENCE!! AWE!!

## The Creator. Ch 4: 1-11
pg 76.
- God is central
- The whole room is oriented toward God
- hard to describe God exactly
  - Radiant light
  - also thunder, lightning, obvious POWER
    - be weary of approaching with a casual air.
  - there is a difference between human and divine
  - the mystery and transcendence of God
    - He is not just a powerful" human."

### The 4 creatures pg 77
- one with a human face
- a lion
- an ox
- an eagle
- represent all living creatures
- Creation itself worships God
- They only add "Amen" to the chorus **after ALL creation** has joined in
- The chorus brings awareness to primary attributes of God: He is supremely holy,
- His POWER AND PURITY set God apart from all other creatures.
- All who join in the praise recognize their own impurity and powerlessness.

### The 24 elders pg 78
- no real clue about who they are or who they represent
- dressed in white robes and wearing crowns
- three specific promises shown as fulfilled
  - white robes-3 :5
  - crowns-2:10
  - a place at the throne-3:21

### Three-fold existence of God 4: 8
- God is the one being who" was and is and is to come."
- Our three-fold dependence on God 4:11
  - God created all things
  - God's will brought them into being
  - God's power is what created them.
- The elders direct attention to God 4:10
  - leave their thrones
  - lie prostrate before God
  - cast their crowns in front of themselves before God,
  - thrones and crowns are viewed as
  - undeserved gifts
  - Not more valuable than being in God's presence,
- Contrast God's throne with human kingdoms. pg 79
  - No human is due the honor, glory, and the praises due to God.
  - God alone is due the honors, glories and praise of all creation
  - No one has the pure virtues and power of God.
  - God's throne will remain the central seat of all power as we go through the other cycles
  - Humans and other evils will try to take God's place and usurp His power
    - The throne of Satan
    - the dragon keeps his crown and does not surrender it to God like the elders

### How would these visions strike the members of the 7 churches? pg 80
Three problems-three viewpoints
1. The persecuted churches would probably be reassured since God's power and holiness are above all human devices of evil they might face
2. Those that accommodate the pagan religious culture are probable uneasy, because they might question if they could be present if they are compromising worship of God while on Earth
3. The complacent and self-satisfied probably found it disturbing. They are not like the elders, but they hold on to things that give them wealth and prestige.
But the chorus is open to all who want to join.

## THE LAMB 5: 1-14 pg 80
- The scroll is in God's right hand
  - It indicates some part of God's will that has not yet been carried out,
- No created being can open it. ALL are unworthy

### The difference between what John hears and what he sees.
- John *hears* one of the elders say
  - The Lion of Judah, the Root of David has conquered
  - Obvious reference to Christ.  Isa 11: 1-0
  - John hears the old Testament promise of victory and God's power
    - a powerful and righteous ruler
- John *sees* a Lamb
  - The Lamb looks like it has bees slaughtered.
  - **THE VISION IS STARTLING!**
    - He expects to see a powerful, fearsome LION BUT instead there is a Lamb that looks" slaughtered"
  - John sees the crucifixion of Christ in the New Testament
  - 7 horns-the horn symbolizes royal power.
  - 7 eyes-the 7 fold spirit of God Rev 5:6, Isa 11:1-3a

#### why word pictures? pg 82
- Invoking a range of associations.
- Slaughtered Lamb
- Passover
- Sacrifice: a purposeful death
- Isaiah's servant of the Lord. Isa 53:7,10
  - a lamb lead to the slaughter
  - through him the will of the Lord shall prosper
- Vulnerability, sacrificial death, and deliverance
- appeals to the emotion and will
- Juxtaposing the Lion and the Lamb
  - The power of redemptive self-giving

### Focus shifts to the Lamb. pg 83
- harps now play to the Lamb.
- incense( prayer) placed before the Lamb.
- a new song proclaims the Lamb worthy.
- still the Lamb does not usurp God.
  - the Lamb's sacrifice served God's purpose
    - to ransom people for God.

God's way vs Man's way
- Rome conquered by inflicting pain on others,
  - Rome flexed its muscle
  - Rome took by force
  - Rome victimized
- God conquered by offering Himself incarnate in Jesus as the final sacrifice for sin
  - God yielded power He could have exercised
  - God called people together into His Kingdom instead of forcing them
  - God renewed the relationship between Himself and humanity by showing love is stronger than physical power.

### The host of angels pg 84
- The vision widens to take in the unnumbered host of angels surrounding God, the Lamb, the 4 creatures, and the elders.
- The angels add to the accolades they praise the Lamb with, Rev 5:12
  - They extol the Lamb alongside God
    - Not instead of God
- The whole earth joins the song Rev 5:13
  - Now the 4 creatures add the" Amen! '
  - This is God's will for the world,
- Adding your voice to the song might cost you something
  - All the members of the churches are invited
  - Later visions
    - many gain power and wealth from Babylon
      - Babylon's claims will prove false
      - Babylon's downfall in chapter 18 is a counterpoint to the opening celebration in chapters 4 and 5.

Chapter 3 continued. The seals
