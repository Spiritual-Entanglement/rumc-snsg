## Chapter 4: Trumpets of Terror and Hope
### The Two Witnesses

**"Repentance, not destruction is what God desires"** pg 97

#### Church oppressed Rev 11:1-2
- The church will become under severe oppression,
- The church does not retreat
- "Two" witnesses come forward
  - They represent the whole church, not just two individual people
  - sackcloth indicates the tone of their message
  - they are calling people to repentance
    - people did not repent under the plagues of the first six trumpets
    - there is still time to repent.
  - Two witnesses are required in court to establish truth Deut 19:15
    > 15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
  - Jesus is called God's faithful witness in Rev 1:15 and 3:14
  - The martyr Antipas was named as a witness in Rev 2:13.
#### Comparable to witnesses and prophets of old.
- Olive trees and lamp stands Rev 11: 4; Zech 3:1-4:14.
  > 4:14 Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”
  - the church as priests of a Kingdom that opposes Roman Empire.
- Their words are like fire. Jer 5:14
  > 14 Therefore the LORD, the God of Armies says, “Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it will devour them.
- Like Elijah - they have power to cause drought and fire
  > 1 Kings 17:1 Elijah the Tishbite, who was one of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.”
  > 1 Kings 18:38 Then the LORD’s fire fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust; and it licked up the water that was in the trench.
  > 2 Kings 1:10 Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.
- Like Moses-can turn water to blood and send plagues. Exod 7:17 -21
  > 20 Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 21 The fish that were in the river died. The river became foul. The Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river. The blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
- Like Jesus they are faithful to the point of death
- They share the fate of all slain prophets for speaking the word of God
  - Even with all the power of fire, droughts, plagues, contaminated water, etc. the unfaithful are not defeated
  - instead they are martyred.
#### Denied Burial
- The martyred Christians are not buried.
  - They are left in the street.
  - Some crucified by Rome were left on the cross and never taken down
    - others were thrown into open mass graves.
    - This was an area outside Rome
- This shows great disrespect to those who were slain.
- The beast, from the bottomless pit, the abyss, is the only one who can overcome and kill them.
- They are kill in all the most evil places of the world, here represented as Sodom, Egypt, and the" great" city Babylon.
  - Babylon equals Rome
  - the implications is Christians will be killed all over the world, especially areas that have a lot of" religions" that oppose Christianity.
- Most of the world will celebrate the death of the witnesses
#### The Tables are Turned
- God resurrects the witnesses
  - THIS strikes fear in the people
    - Now they begin to fear God
    - Now they begin to believe.
- There is a reversal in the destruction that comes with the trumpets.
  - Previous disasters destroy one-third of the earth
  - One-third of humanity dies by the army from Trumpet 6
  - YET, at the end of chapter 11, only one-tenth are lost.
  - Isa 6:13 only one-tenth would survive
    > If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed,
as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down, so the holy seed is its stump.”
  - Amos 5:3 nine-tenths would be destroyed
    >  For the Lord GOD says: “The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”
  - NOW nine-tenths are praising God
  - The witness, death, and resurrection of the faithful witnesses accomplish what violence and destruction cannot:
    - The people see that God is real,
    - The people see God WILL save those who are faithful to Him.
  - All but seven thousand give glory to God. Rev 11:13
    > In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
  - Rev 14:7 Conversion of sinners is God's will, not destruction
    > He said with a loud voice, “Fear the Lord, and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!”
  - NOW it is declared that the second woe has past
    - Get ready for the third woe
#### The Kingdom of the LORD
- Rev 11:15 -19
- John uses surprise reversals to illustrate how we cannot accurately anticipate what God will do next, nor how He will do it.
  - First woe.
    - Fifth trumpet - hoard of locust
  - The second woe is announced after the lesser judgement and nine-tenths of those who survived praise God when the witnesses are resurrected.
    - Sixth trumpet-one-third of humanity dies
  - Seventh trumpet begins another round of Heavenly worship. Rev 11:15 -16
      > 15 The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!”
16 The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God’s throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
    - God's Kingdom is established
    - Another change: it announces God as the one who was and is
      - no future tense
      - Rev 11:17, pg 113, The Kingdom is now.
        > 17 saying: “We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was,† because you have taken your great power and reigned.  
    - woe to the nations and people who have opposed God. Rev 11:18. Top of pg 114
#### No Rapture.
- middle of page 114
  - "The victory of God that is announced here..."
  - Rom 8:18-25
#### The ark appears in Heaven
- The people should prepare to meet God.
  - The faithful, the penitent can hope in God's mercy
  - Those who do not repent will face judgement
- with the arks appearance, more lightning, thunder, hail, and earthquakes.
  - The next cycle is about to begin.
  - Before it was lost, the ark, in addition to being in the Holy of Holies in the Temple, was carried before Israel into battle.
  - A new set of battles against God's Kingdom is about to begin
