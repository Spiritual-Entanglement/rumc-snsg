**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 6**
The text of Rule 6:
> Sixth Rule (Spiritual Desolation: A Time for Initiative). The sixth: although in
desolation we should not change our first proposals, it is very advantageous to change
ourselves intensely against the desolation itself, as by insisting more upon prayer,
meditation, upon much examination, and upon extending ourselves in some suitable
way of doing penance. (SE 319)

The Sixth rule describes the second step in dealing with spiritual desolation.
* This is the most active and encouraging rule.
  * In desolation: **ACT**, take initiative! Resist darkness with faith, prayer, and scripture.
* Remember:
  * Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.
  * Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
* Again, he reminds us to not change anything about our spiritual life or practices.
  * Not spiritual direction
  * Not any discernments made during the last time in spiritual *consolation*.
  * Not prayer commitments
  * Wait until clarity and consolation return.
* Rule 6 compliments rule 5.
  * **Don't** change your decisions or practices; **DO** change yourself.
  * We don't change direction or practice, but we increase effort.
* Active Interior Resistance:
  * **DO** change your resolve to fight the desolation itself.
    * Decide to actively resist the desolation.
    * Pay attention to your inner state: moods and feelings.
      * See them as tools the enemy could use to increase feelings of desolation.
        * Identify the moods and thoughts that pull you down: name them!
        * Name them in prayer before God.
        * Awareness is the first step in resistance.
      * Use prayer, inner self-examination, and scripture to resist giving into desolation.
    * Act against the desolation
      * If tempted no forego prayers <==> pray more.
      * If tempted to wallow in discouragement <==> actively remember how God has shown you grace and mercy in the past.
* We cannot bring ourselves out of desolation.
  * Only God can bring us out of desolation.
    * We depend on Him
  * There are times when God allows desolation.  Coming in Rule 9.
* The idea of Penance:
  * Embrace acts of penance as a resistance to desolation.
  * Remember that in our weakness God's grace works most powerfully.
  * Confession of sin is an act of penance.
  * Penance does not have to be harsh:
    * Penance is ***not*** about punishment.
    * Penance is about **freedom** not **guilt**.
    * the goal is to turn the heart toward humility and dependence on God
* The goal is spiritual freedom
  * The ability to follow God no matter how we feel: consolation or desolation.
    * Freedom to do as we decide, **not** to do as our feelings and mood dictate.
      * or the blowing winds of temptation.
* Rules 7 and 8 will address attitudes that sustain our efforts: trust and patience.

**Scripture in support of Rule 6**
* 🛡️ 1. James 4:7–8
> “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.”
  * Why it fits:
    * This verse perfectly summarizes Ignatius’s agere contra (“act against”) principle. When desolation tempts us to withdraw, we move toward God instead — through prayer, examination, and faithfulness.
* ⚔️ 2. Ephesians 6:10–11
> “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power.  Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”
  - Why it fits:
    - Ignatius sees desolation as a time of spiritual battle, not surrender.
    - The “armor of God” — prayer, truth, righteousness, and perseverance — are the same tools he prescribes in Rule 6.

* 🙏 3. Psalm 27:13–14
> “I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living!  Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!”
  - Why it fits:
    - When consolation disappears, this psalm calls us to active waiting — not passivity, but courageous trust.
    - Ignatius’s “be more intent on prayer” echoes this attitude of hopeful perseverance.

* 💧 4. Romans 12:11–12
> “Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord.  Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer.”
  - Why it fits:
    - Rule 6 tells us to increase prayer and perseverance precisely when we least feel like it.
    - Paul’s exhortation captures that same dynamic of faith-driven endurance.

* 🔥 5. 1 Peter 5:8–10
> “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.  Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brothers and sisters throughout the world.  And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace… will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.”
  - Why it fits:
    - Ignatius teaches that perseverance in desolation strengthens us and that God Himself will eventually restore consolation — exactly as Peter promises here.

* ✨ Perfect Summary: Romans 8:37
> “In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.”
  - Why it fits:
    - Rule 6 is not about endurance alone, but about victory through grace.
    - It reminds us that resistance is not grim stoicism — it’s faith expressing love in the face of trial.
