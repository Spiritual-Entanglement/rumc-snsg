**Thursday Night Small Group**
**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1**
**Summary**

- First Week Rules of Discernment:
  - The Week 1 Rules teach us to recognize the inner movements that draw us toward God or away from Him, to receive the good spirit’s encouragement and resist the enemy’s discouragement. In times of consolation, we give thanks and strengthen our resolve; in times of desolation, we stay faithful, patient, and grounded in prayer until God’s light returns.

**Rules for the First Week — Summary Review**

- Rule 1 – When Moving Away from God:
  - When a person is trapped in sin, the enemy makes sin seem sweet and harmless, while the good spirit stirs the conscience with unease to call the soul back to God.
- Rule 2 – When Moving Toward God:
  - When someone is sincerely growing in faith, the enemy brings fear, confusion, and obstacles, while the good spirit strengthens, encourages, and brings peace.
- Rule 3 – Spiritual Consolation:
  - Consolation is an interior peace and joy that lifts the heart toward God, deepens faith, hope, and love, and fills the soul with gratitude and trust in His presence.
- Rule 4 – Spiritual Desolation:
  - Desolation is the darkness, heaviness, or discouragement that makes us feel far from God — a time of temptation to lose hope, faith, and love.
- Rule 5 – Fidelity in Desolation:
  - When in desolation, never make a change in your spiritual direction or commitments; hold firm to what you resolved in the light of consolation.
- Rule 6 – Initiative in Desolation:
  - Although you shouldn’t change your direction, you should resist desolation actively — by praying more, examining yourself, and doing small acts of penance or charity.
- Rule 7 – Trusting God’s Grace in Desolation:
  - Remember that God’s grace is still with you, even when you can’t feel it; He allows you to stand firm in faith and grow stronger through the trial.
- Rule 8 – Patience and Hope in Desolation:
  - Be patient, trusting that consolation will return; desolation is temporary, and steadfast endurance opens the heart to new grace.
- Rule 9 – Why God Allows Desolation:
  - God may permit desolation to awaken us from spiritual laziness, to test our faith and love, or to teach us humility and dependence on His grace.
- Rule 10 – Preparing in Consolation:
  - In times of consolation, store up strength and make firm resolutions for how you’ll stay faithful when desolation comes again.
- Rule 11 – Finding Balance:
  - In consolation, stay humble and remember your weakness; in desolation, stay confident and remember God’s strength.
- Rule 12 – Standing Firm Against Temptation:
  - Resist temptation boldly and immediately — the enemy loses courage when met with strength and resolve.
- Rule 13 – Bringing Darkness to Light:
  - Don’t keep your struggles or temptations secret; reveal them to a wise spiritual guide or confessor, and the enemy’s power will fade.
- Rule 14 – Guarding Your Weak Point:
  - The enemy attacks where we are weakest; stay alert and strengthen those vulnerable areas through prayer, self-knowledge, and grace.
