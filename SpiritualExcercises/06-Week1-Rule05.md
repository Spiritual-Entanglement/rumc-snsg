**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 5**
The text of Rule 5:
> Fifth Rule (Spiritual Desolation: A Time for Fidelity). The fifth: in time of desolation never make a change, but be firm and constant in the proposals and determination in which one was the day preceding such desolation, or in the determination in which one was in the preceding consolation. Because, as in consolation the good spirit guides and counsels us more, so in desolation the bad spirit, with whose counsels we cannot find the way to a right decision. (SE 318)

The Fifth rule describes the first step in dealing with spiritual desolation.
* **This rule is one of the most important**.
  * It is also one of the hardest to follow...
  * This is **the first defense** against panic and confusion.
  * **DO NOT** alter your prayer life/habit/routine when you find yourself in desolation.
* Remember:
  * Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.
  * Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
* In desolation, the evil spirit will do everything in its power to discourage prayer and reading of scripture.
  * **BUT Remember** God allows times of desolation so we can grow in perseverance and a strengthening of our faith, hope, trust, and love.
  * You will feel as if prayer is ineffective.
  * You will feel unworthy to pray or even look at scripture.
 s * Many discouraging thoughts or emotions will be applied to keep you from prayer.
  * **YET** our prayers are even **more** meritorious at this time.
    * This is the time when the rubber meets the road.
    * We are praying out of faith, hope, trust, and love instead of just chasing a spiritual high.
* **REMEMBER** God has not changed; our ability to perceive Him has changed.
  * God is still as close to you as always even if you cannot *feel* it.
  * Fidelity relies on **GOD's** constancy, **not** our emotional state.
* Do not change anything from the last time you felt close to God, your last time in consolation
  * Not spiritual direction
  * Not any discernments made at that time.
  * Not prayer commitments
  * Not spiritual direction.
  * Wait until clarity and consolation return.
* Prayer and scripture are your lifeline to God.
* If the evil spirit can get you to stop reading scripture and praying, you will start to grow weaker spiritually.
  * The 'habit' of prayer is broken it is harder to get restarted sometimes.
    * Keeping our heart ready for God's grace makes it easier to receive when consolation returns.
  * In a spiritually weakened state, you are much more susceptible to temptations.
* Now is the time to build fidelity and fortitude when faced with struggle.
  * We build spiritual muscle by praying especially when we do not feel like it.
  * Keeping your prayer and scripture reading during desolation helps to build up our resistance, patience, and resilience during any struggle.
* This is why it is so important to build good prayer and scripture habits in consolation, so we can maintain them during desolation.
  * During desolation, prayer and scripture, may seem almost mechanical and dry.
  * The value of perseverance and patience will become evident, and a cause for praise of God, when the next state of consolation comes.
  * You will 'feel' spiritually stronger, and **yet** humble too, because **GOD** gets you through that time, not your own efforts.
    * Yes, **your** effort made you show up,
    * **BUT GOD** gives the increase and the victory.

**Stay Faithful**
Decisions made or changed in darkness do not lead to God's light.  Keep faithful to resolutions made in consolation.

**Next**
Rules 6-8 are going to show us *how* to act in desolation.  Not by changing decisions or habits, but by changing ourselves via prayer and patience.

**VERSES for Rule 5**
🕯️ 1. Isaiah 50:10 — Trusting God in Darkness
> “Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the voice of his servant?
Let the one who walks in darkness and has no light
trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.”

- Why it fits:
  - This is the classic Scriptural foundation for Rule 5. Ignatius is echoing this very idea — when light disappears, don’t change direction; trust the Lord who has not changed.

🌄 2. Psalm 37:5–7 — Be Still and Wait for the Lord
> “Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act.
Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him;
do not fret when people succeed in their ways.”

- Why it fits:
  - In desolation, we’re tempted to act impulsively. This psalm teaches the opposite: stay steady and patient, because God will act in His time. It’s fidelity under pressure — exactly what Rule 5 calls for.

🪞 3. Lamentations 3:21–26 — Hope Quietly for God’s Salvation
> “But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;
his mercies never come to an end;
they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
The Lord is good to those who wait for him,
to the soul that seeks him.
It is good that one should wait quietly
for the salvation of the Lord.”

- Why it fits:
  - This is Ignatian discernment in biblical form: when consolation fades and the soul feels abandoned, recall God’s past faithfulness and wait quietly for His return.

⚔️  4. James 1:2–4 — Perseverance in Testing
> “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,
because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.”

- Why it fits:
  - Desolation tests our faith. Rule 5 teaches that staying constant through the test deepens maturity — exactly what James describes here.

🕊️ 5. Hebrews 10:35–36 — Hold Steady with Confidence
> “Do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God,
you will receive what he has promised.”

- Why it fits:
  - Ignatius warns that desolation clouds judgment — it’s not the time to throw away commitments made in consolation. Hebrews urges perseverance and confidence in that very moment.

🌙 6. Psalm 62:1–2, 5–6 — Wait in Silence for God Alone
> “For God alone my soul waits in silence;
from him comes my salvation.
He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall never be shaken.
...
For God alone my soul waits in silence, for my hope is from him.”

- Why it fits:
  - Desolation often tempts us to act rashly or seek quick relief. This psalm counsels stillness and trust — the inner posture of Ignatian fidelity.
