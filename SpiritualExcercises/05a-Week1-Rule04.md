**Scripture verses for Rule 4: Desolation**

1. Psalm 42:5
> “Why are you cast down, O my soul,
and why are you in turmoil within me?
Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
my salvation and my God.”
* Why it fits:
  * This psalm beautifully matches desolation: the soul feels downcast, yet the psalmist refuses to surrender and commands himself to hope. This is exactly the Ignatian posture in desolation.

2. Psalm 22:1–2
> “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
Why are you so far from helping me…?
O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,
and by night, but I find no rest.”
* Why it fits:
  * Ignatius emphasizes that desolation feels like being far from God, even though God is truly near. This psalm gives voice to that painful and very real spiritual experience — and Jesus Himself prays it on the Cross.

3. Isaiah 50:10
> “Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the voice of his servant?
Let the one who walks in darkness and has no light
trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.”
* Why it fits:
  * This verse expresses one of Ignatius’ most important discernment principles: When in spiritual darkness, do not change direction — trust and remain faithful.
  * As we will see, this directly supports Rules 4–6.

4. 2 Corinthians 5:7
> “For we walk by faith, not by sight.”
* Why it fits:
  * Desolation removes the feeling of God’s presence. Ignatius teaches that faithfulness in desolation is one of the highest acts of love, because it trusts God without emotional confirmation.

5. James 4:7–8
> “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.”
* Fits well if teaching the action to take during desolation — perseverance and resistance.

**This one connects Rules 3 & 4 together:**
Habakkuk 3:17–18
> Though the fig tree does not blossom
and there be no fruit on the vines…
yet I will rejoice in the Lord,
I will exult in the God of my salvation.

* This is the decision to remain faithful in desolation, rooted in hope.
  * It is the spiritual maturity Rules 3 & 4 are leading toward.
