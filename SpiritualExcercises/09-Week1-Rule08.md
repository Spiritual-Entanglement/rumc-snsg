**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 8**
The text of Rule 8:
> Eighth Rule (Spiritual Desolation: A Time for Patience). The eighth: let one who is in desolation work to be in patience, which is contrary to the vexations which come to him, and let him think that he will soon be consoled, diligently using the means against such desolation, as is said in the sixth rule. (SE 321) 

The Eighth rule describes the fourth step in dealing with spiritual desolation.
- Summary of rules about desolation:
  - Rule 5: Don't change spiritual direction or practices.
  - Rule 6: Take initiative against desolation.
  - Rule 7: Trust that God still supports you.
  - Rule 8: Be patient
- Remember:
  - Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
    - Most spiritual growth begins in desolation.
  - Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.
    - Recovery and rest is where spiritual muscle gains strength for the next trial.
- In desolation: **TRUST** in God's grace.
- In desolation:
  - We are **actively** working against it.
    - We don't change (subtract from) any spiritual habits or practices.
    - We intensify our current spiritual practices.
      - Pray more or more intensely.
      - Read more scripture.
    - We reaffirm for ourselves that God has not abandoned us even though we may not sense His presence.
- The next thing is to exercise spiritual patience.
  - Biblical patience is staying faithful under pressure: steady, faithful obedience.
    - Biblical patience is **NOT** just "staying calm" or an emotional response.
    - Faithful endurance
      - keep our eye on the Cross and the empty tomb, even if they are not clearly visible.
  - Desolation causes reactions like:
    - "This is never going to end."
      - *Permanence* in desolation is a lie!
    - "I have to fix this now."
    - "Where is God?"
    - "Something is wrong."
  - Expect the next consolation to come soon.
    - This helps us recognize that the Holy Spirit is working in us still.
    - It helps us recognize that desolation in not permanent.
    - We don't demand consolation; we expect it.
      - Not my timeline, God, but yours.
  - There may be an important lesson to be learned.
  - Desolation strengthens us for future trials.
  - Remember rule 7: God has left us with sufficient grace to wade through this desolation.
  - Remember rule 6: intensify our spiritual efforts through the grace God has already show us.
  - Rule 5 is protected by rule 8.
    - It keeps us from making impulsive changes to our spiritual practices.
    - Don't make changes because we are spiritually uncomfortable.
      - Stick to God's truth and His promises.

**Versus that support Rule 8:**
📖 Lamentations 3:31–33
> “For the Lord will not cast off forever;
but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion
according to the abundance of his steadfast love.”

  - 🧭 Ignatian connection: Desolation is real — but not permanent. This verse almost directly paraphrases Ignatius’s reassurance.

📖 Psalm 30:5
> “Weeping may tarry for the night,
but joy comes with the morning.”

  - 🧭 Ignatian connection: Exactly what Ignatius means by “let him think that he will soon be consoled.”

📖 Romans 5:3–5
> “We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
and endurance produces character, and character produces hope…”

  - 🧭 Ignatian connection: Desolation forms endurance (patience), not despair.

📖 Hebrews 10:36
> “You have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.”

  - 🧭 Ignatian connection: Rule 8 is about enduring while continuing to do God’s will, even when consolation is absent.

📖 James 5:7–8
> “Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord…
Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.”

  - 🧭 Ignatian connection: Patience strengthens the heart during delay — exactly what Rule 8 teaches.
