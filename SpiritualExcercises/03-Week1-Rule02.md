**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 2**
The text of Rule 2:
> Second Rule (When a Person Moves Toward God). The second: in persons who are going on intensely purifying their sins and rising from good to better in the service of God our Lord, the method is contrary to that in the first rule. For then it is proper to the evil spirit to bite, sadden, and place obstacles, disquieting with false reasons, so that the person may not go forward. And it is proper to the good spirit to give courage and strength, consolations, tears, inspirations, and quiet, easing and taking away all obstacles, so that the person may go forward in doing good. (SE 315)

The second rule describes what is happening when we intentionally strive to get closer to God.
* The spiritual movement in our hearts is opposite from that in Rule 1.
  * Our soul is actively seeking to draw closer to God.
* The evil spirit:
  * Now he takes the opposite tack because he is losing ground.
  * Floods you will discouragement:
    * You will never be good enough. Your past is too tainted.
    * You do you think you are?  You are fooling yourself.
    * How can God love someone like you due to all the things you have done?
    * Other words of fear, confusion, depression, etc.
  * Temptations may get stronger.
  * Doubts may grow louder
* The good spirit:
  * comes gently, but powerfully.
  * Remember from Acts and Revelation how God does not move or act in huge displays of what we recognize as power.  "The still **small** voice."  "The **Lamb** of God."
  * Deep heart feeling will be along these lines.
    * the weight of a burden lifted....even if the burden is still there.
    * courage in our soul.
    * light and peace.
    * felling God's mercy, grace, compassion, presence, patience, etc.
    * A confidence that we are doing good.
    * A confidence that at this moment we are operating within God's will.
  * In the midst of the struggle, the peace, courage, and quiet joy are gifts from the Spirit that keep guiding us forward.

**Combined Thoughts on Rules 1 & 2**
* We need to learn to recognize these inner movements in our hearts.
  * Resist false peace that is creating distance between us and God.
  * Trust a steady peace the is drawing us closer to God.
  * Can I continue what I am doing and look God in the eye?
* The War between the Spirit and the flesh is real.
  * Galatians 5:16-17
    > “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.  For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.  They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.”
  * Romans 7:22-23
    > “For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.”
  * Romans 8:5-6
    > “For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.  The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.”
