**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 10**
- Remember:
  - Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
  - Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.

The text of Rule 10:
> Tenth Rule (Spiritual Consolation: A Time to Prepare). The tenth: let the one who is in consolation think how he will conduct himself in the desolation which will come after, taking new strength for that time. (SE 323) 

The Tenth rule charges us to be mindful that consolation is given to us by God and is not a permanent state.
- This rule can help guard against pride and self-congratulation.
  - **Consolation is a gift, not a reward.**
  - It is not permanent, not earned
  - Rule 10 is **bridge** between a time of consolation and the return of desolation.
    - Consolation is a time of preparation, not relaxation.
- Desolation *will* come again at some time.
  - Desolation is not a punishment.
    - It is not because God is displeased with us.
    - Nor is it because God is absent or out of reach.
  - It is a corrective against spiritual pride and entitlement.
- A time of consolation is a time to grow in resolve, gratitude, and clarity.
  - We make decisions about our spiritual disciplines here.
    - Take direct action to strengthen our relationship with God through prayer, scripture, worship, etc.
    - We can evaluate our last time of desolation.
      - Not failure analysis.
      - We are more interested in humility and strategy.
      - Where could we be more attentive, and respond more faithfully next time.
    - We remember clearly how desolation effected us, and
      - we decide in advance how we will respond next time when desolation returns.
      - We can remember consolation during desolation -- We can remember God's fidelity to us
        - We can store up spiritual strength from consolation.
  - Consolation is not a time to relax our fidelity to God.
    - It is a time to remember and thank God for His fidelity to us.
    - It is a time to exercise fidelity with humility.
  - God grants us the grace to see us through desolation.
    - We can remember consolation during desolation -- We can remember God's fidelity to us
      - We can store up spiritual strength from consolation.
  - He also grants us the grace to be humble in consolation.
    - And, prepare ourselves, by fidelity, and drawing upon God's presence in our lives, both now and in the coming future.
    - Consolation trains our spiritual memory,
      - It gives us confidence that God's faithfulness is real even when we cannot **FEEL** it.
- Hold lightly to times of consolation.
  - Hold consolation is all humility and gratitude.
  - Hold tightly to God, not to times of consolation and *good spiritual feelings.*
  - Hold consolation lightly; **God is our true good**, regardless of our feelings.
