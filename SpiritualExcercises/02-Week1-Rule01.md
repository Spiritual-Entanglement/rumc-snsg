**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 1**
The text of Rule 1:
> First Rule (When a Person Moves Away from God). The first rule: in persons who
are going from mortal sin to mortal sin, the enemy is ordinarily accustomed to propose apparent pleasures to them, leading them to imagine sensual delights and pleasures in order to hold them more and make them grow in their vices and sins. In these persons the good spirit uses a contrary method, stinging and biting their consciences through their rational power of moral judgment. (SE 314)

The first rule describes what is happening when we fall into sin.
* We are effectively drifting (or purposefully) moving away from God.
  * Be sure: God is not leaving us.
  * We are pulling our heart away from God.
* The evil spirit:
  * First, personifying evil helps us recognize and resist evil in all its forms.
  * talks us into sin.
    * its pleasurable, harmless, and satisfying.
      * for a time, anyway...
  * the goal is to trap us into patterns of behavior
    * The more addictive the better.
      * addiction can be physical, emotional, and/or mental.
    * It starts slow and builds up just like any addiction.
    * It is very hard to break out of.
  * Also, gives us perceptions of friendships and love with others caught in the same sinful activity.
    * Yes, those caught up in sin, cannot truly love since all the behavior is coming from places of selfishness, pride, and power.
  * He usually does this by talking to us in comforting words to give us a false peace.
  * He wants us to stay asleep in spiritual darkness
    * as our spiritual life drifts farther and farther from God.
* The good spirit: "Holy Spirit", "Angels?"
  * Works in the opposite manner.
    * pricks our conscience: guilt, etc.
    * makes us restless and uneasy.
    * tries to make us aware of our drifting away from God.
  * He wants us
    * to awaken to the darkness we have found ourselves in.
    * to see the emptiness and oppressiveness of sin
    * to long for the mercy, grace, and live that come from our relationship with God.
      * And the relationships that come out of a pure church family.
