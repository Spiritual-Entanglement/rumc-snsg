**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 7**
The text of Rule 7:
> Seventh Rule (Spiritual Desolation: A Time for Resistance). The seventh: let one who is in desolation consider how the Lord has left him in trial in his natural powers, so that he may resist the various agitations and temptation of the enemy; since he can resist with the divine help, which always remains with him, though he does not clearly feel it; for the Lord has taken away from him his great fervor, abundant love, and intense grace, leaving him, however, sufficient grace for eternal salvation. (SE 320)

The Seventh rule describes the third step in dealing with spiritual desolation.
- Summary of rules about desolation:
  - Rule 5: Don't change spiritual direction or practices.
  - Rule 6: Take initiative against desolation.
  - Rule 7: Trust that God still supports you.
- Remember:
  - Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
    - Most spiritual growth begins in desolation.
  - Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.
    - Recovery and rest is where spiritual growth, gains strength for the next trial.
- In desolation: **TRUST** in God's grace.
- In desolation God invites us to exercise our faithfulness, trust, and resolve to resist evil and temptations of all kinds.
  - It is a time to take another step in spiritual maturity.
    - Desolation strengthens mature faith.
  - He has already built us up, and supplied us with sufficient grace to resist this episode.
  - walking in faith is like a muscle which grows stronger with frequent exercise.
- The Goal:
  - Remember the goal is true spiritual freedom
    - Freedom *FROM* spiritual slavery to sin, and being ruled by our passions and emotions.
      - Jesus accomplished freedom from slavery by His death on the cross and His resurrection.
    - Freedom *TO* make a choice about which path we will follow: Good or bad.
      - Jesus' victory is always available to us.
        - It is free for us to claim it, but we must choose it each time.
- In desolation, we may feel as if we are abandoned by God.
  - One reason is that, this "feeling" is a prompt for us, to purposefully work to draw near to God.
  - Our relationship with God is always left up to our choice, and even in desolation, God gives us the grace to choose Him.
    - Even our desire to choose God is moved by His grace.
    - Our will is important in cooperation with God's will
      - but only His grace can empower and bring it to completion.
- We still rely on God's divine help, even in desolation.
  - The enemy exaggerates our fears, weaknesses, and feelings of discouragement, to make us feel alone.
    - One of our tasks is to resist these lies of the enemy, and trust in God's grace.
    - (The other tasks are to strengthen our resolve to *not* change our spiritual direction or practices.)
  - We are **NOT** left on our own to fight evil and temptation.
    - God has withdrawn the *felt* experience of grace and consolation.
    - ***BUT real*** grace is still in us through the Holy Spirit, enabling us to resist.
  - God's help is always available for us to rely on Him to help us fight temptation and evil.
  - This is a time to hope and trust in God's help even if we cannot feel it.
  - God still hears us when we are tempted to think He is not listening to our pleas.
- Summary
  - God's grace is still present, but may be hard to 'feel' or detect.
  - Purpose: to recognize grace is still there even during trials.
  - The absence of ***felt*** grace does not mean the absence of ***REAL*** grace.
    - God's support is *quieter* in desolation, but no less ***REAL***.
  - God's grace is essential for us to successfully draw near to Him when in trials and temptations.

**Versus that support Rule 7:**

🛡️ 1. 2 Corinthians 12:9
> “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”

  - This is the best Scriptural summary of Rule 7.  Paul says God’s grace is strongest when we feel weakest.

🌅 2. Psalm 73:23–26
> “Yet I am always with you;
you hold me by my right hand…
My flesh and my heart may fail,
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”

  - Rule 7 repeats this truth: God is present even when unfelt.

🔥 3. Isaiah 41:10
> “Do not fear, for I am with you;
do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
I will strengthen you; I will help you;
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”

  - Ignatius says: the soul can resist because divine help always remains with him, though he does not clearly feel it.
  - Isaiah says: God strengthens, helps, and upholds you.

🕯️ 4. Psalm 34:17–18
> “The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;
he delivers them from all their troubles.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

  - Rule 7 emphasizes that desolation feels like abandonment — but God is especially near in that moment. This psalm expresses God’s nearness in the very center of spiritual difficulty.

⚔️ 5. Ephesians 6:10–13
> “Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power.
Put on the whole armor of God,
so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil…
and having done everything, to stand firm.”

  - Ignatius: “God leaves us with sufficient grace to resist the enemy’s agitations and temptations.”
  - Rule 7 in Paul's voice: “Stand firm… be strong in the Lord… resist the schemes of the devil.”

✨ Psalm 138:7
> “Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life.”

This is the essence of Rule 7: “I feel trouble. I feel weakness. But God preserves me.”
