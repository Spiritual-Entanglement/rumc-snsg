**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 4**
The text of Rule 4:
> Fourth Rule (Spiritual Desolation). The fourth is of spiritual desolation. I call desolation all the contrary of the third rule, such as darkness of soul, disturbance in it, movement to (toward) low and earthly things, disquiet from various agitations and temptation, moving to lack of confidence, without hope, without love, finding oneself totally slothful, tepid, sad and, as if separated from one’s Creator and Lord. For just as consolation is contrary to desolation, in the same way the thoughts that come from consolation are contrary to the thoughts that come from desolation. (SE 317)

The fourth rule describes what "spiritual desolation" means.
* Medical/Psychological caveat:
  * Desolation and consolation can be effected by our natural mood swings and physical hormonal fluctuations.
    * Sadness and depression are not always desolation.
      * (Just as happiness and elation are not always consolation.)
      * They could be caused by actual chemical changes in the brain.
      * This requires diagnosis by a trained doctor.
        * **DO NOT** stop taking, currently prescribed, medications without discussing it with the prescribing physician.
      * In this case, and in my own opinion, the feeling of sadness or depression (being identified as desolation) would last longer than normal spiritual desolation, and is a sign that expert medical help may be indicated.
  * Desolation and consolation can come from physical as well as spiritual causes.
    * It was considered at the time the our physical conditions of fatigue, illness, stress, hunger, etc., "might be" cause by our spiritual desolation.
      * The opposite was also considered: our physical state may be causing spiritual desolation
  * If critical, concerning, and/or confusing, **BOTH** medical professionals **and** spiritual guides should be consulted.
  * ***ALL statements after this are to be considered with the above medical/psychological caveat in mind.***
* As stated: desolation is the opposite of consolation.
* Desolation is **not** spiritual failure.
* Desolation at least makes is seem that we are far from God.
  * This describes our spiritual interior state over and above our emotional state.
    * It is pulling us toward discouragement.
    * A weakening of trust in God despite attempts to validate and strengthen trust.
    * A withdrawal from prayer.
    * Faith, Hope, and Charity seem to be weakening and losing vitality within us. 
  * We may actually still be very near to God spiritually, but temptations and things in our physical, daily life may be causing us this desolate feeling.
  * Desolation is a "feeling" that we are moving away from God.
    * Our efforts to draw near to God may "feel" fruitless.
    * We may experience huge struggles just trying to pray.
    * Temptations may be very persistent despite how much we try to pray them away.
* We can find our selves in consolation on one day and in desolation the next.
  * Those new to faith may find themselves cycling through them several times in the same day.
  * Those mature in faith and prayer may stay in either state for longer periods of time.
  * there is a cycle to it, as in we move from one state to the other, but it is not a mechanical movement like a pendulum.
* To me, it is obvious that someone trapped or pulled back in to the situation described in Rule 1 is going to find themselves in desolation once the excitement and positive chemical reactions wear off.
* The trick here, as we will learn later,  is not to rely on our emotions, but rely on the truths we find in scripture:
  * God is always near to us.
  * God does not abandon us.
* Sometimes God allows us to be in desolation, and we will meet this in Rule 9.  This is a preview.
  * Ignatius taught three reasons God might allow us to be in desolation.
    * It allows us to see that **we depend on God's grace and mercy** alone.
      * It is not by our own efforts that we are saved and advance in grace and holiness.
      * It helps to keep us humble.
    * It helps to purify our motives.
      * We seek God out of love for Him, not the **reward** of **feeling spiritual**.
    * It helps teach us perseverance and a faithfulness.
* Desolation is **not** spiritual failure.
  * Just like consolation is **not** spiritual winning.
  * These are spiritual movements within us.
  * Learning to be aware of which state you are in, is a tool that helps us with the process of discernment.
* Scripture:
  * Ps 42:5, Ps 22:1-2, Is 50:10, James 4:7-8
  * 2Cor 5:7 - We walk by faith, not by sight.

**Summing up rules 3 & 4**
* Consolation is a state in which we "feel" close to God.
  * our spirit within us is being drawn toward God in faith, home, love, trust, peace, etc.
* Desolation is a state in which we "feel" as if we are moving away from God.
  * our spirit within us is being drawn away from God in discouragement, confusion, isolation.
* Both are common to the spiritual life, and everyone experiences them
  * both new and mature Christians.
  * We are not to be **ruled** by these states of consolation and desolation, but to be aware of them, recognise them, and respond with wisdom guided by scripture and prayer.
    * Later rules will be addressing how to respond to consolation and desolation.
* Scripture:
  * Habakkuk 3:17-18
      * The key will be the direction the movements lead our heart,
