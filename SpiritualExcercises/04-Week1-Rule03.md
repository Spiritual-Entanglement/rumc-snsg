**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 3**
The text of Rule 3:
> Third Rule (Spiritual Consolation). The third is of spiritual consolation. I call it consolation when some interior movement is caused in the soul, through which the soul comes to be inflamed with love of its Creator and Lord, and, consequently when it can love no created thing on the face of the earth in itself, but only in the Creator of them all.  Likewise when it sheds tears that move to love of its Lord, whether out of sorrow for one’s sins, or for the passion of Christ our Lord, or because of other things directly ordered to his service and praise. Finally, I call consolation every increase of hope, faith, and charity, and all interior joy that calls and attracts to heavenly things and to the salvation of one’s soul, quieting it and giving it peace in its Creator and Lord. (SE 316)

**Scripture Passages That Correspond to Rule 3**
Philippians 4:6–7
“And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”

Why: consolation is God’s peace that cannot be explained.

Romans 5:5
“God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”

Why: Consolation is God’s love poured into the heart — Ignatius’ central idea.

Psalm 16:11

“In your presence there is fullness of joy;
in your right hand are pleasures forevermore.”

Why: Consolation draws the heart toward God, not earthly pleasure alone.
