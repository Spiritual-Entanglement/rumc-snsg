**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 9**
The text of Rule 9:
> Ninth Rule (Why Does God Allow Spiritual Desolation?). The ninth: there are three principal causes for which we find ourselves desolate. The first is because we are tepid, slothful, or negligent in our spiritual exercises, and so through our faults spiritual consolation withdraws from us. The second, to try us and see how much we are and how much we extend ourselves in his service and praise without so much payment of consolations and increased graces. The third, to give us true recognition and understanding so that we may interiorly feel that it is not ours to attain or maintain increased devotion, intense love, tears or any other spiritual consolation, but that all is the gift and grace of God our Lord, and so that we may not build a nest in something belonging to another, raising our mind in some pride or vainglory, attributing to ourselves the devotion or the other parts of the spiritual consolation. (SE 322)

The Ninth rule describes why God allows us to experience spiritual desolation.
- Remember:
  - Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
    - Most spiritual growth begins in desolation.
  - Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.
    - Recovery and rest is where spiritual muscle gains strength for the next trial.
- This rule is to help guard against despair, confusion, and self-blame.
  - Desolation is not a punishment. It is not because God is displeased with us.
    - Nor is it because God is absent or out of reach.
  - It is a corrective against spiritual pride and entitlement.
  - **Consolation is a gift, not a reward.**
- Three Main Reasons:
  1. We relax, forget, or willfully ignore our spiritual disciplines.
     - Sloth - This is not about general laziness.  In the spiritual context sloth is allowing a lack of enthusiasm to keep us from spiritual things we know are good for our relationship with God.
       - Skipping worship because we don't feel like going.
       - Not praying because we just don't feel like it.
       - Not reading scripture, again because we are not motivated.
     - But it is not just about feelings...
       - this reason is about our failure to use the spiritual means, or tools, available to us, and which we have discerned and committed to.
         - I've discerned and committed myself to a pattern of prayer, scripture, and worship.
       - It is not just about lack of motivation or emotional energy.
     - Sloth is **NOT** when our day is so busy and chaotic that we cannot fit in all of our normal spiritual activities.  I believe there are allowances for this.
     - Consolation is not because of our efforts.
       - Our spiritual disciplines and activities keep us connected to the vine, to God, and from that God's grace allows us to have times of consolation.
       - Ignatius would say, "God ordinarily gives consolation through the means He has already given us."
       - Neglect of these means may cause us to lose or weaken our awareness of God's presence.
  2. As a trial to see if we will continue to praise and glorify Him even without the reward of being in consolation.
     - This is about trustful endurance, not performance.
     - It is easy to praise and glorify God when things are good.  Can we keep it up when things are tough?
     - Remember that God has made available to us the grace necessary to endure each trial.
       - He never withdraws the grace necessary to remain faithful...even when our strength seems to fail.
       - Rule 8 reminds us to expect consolation.
  3. Humility.  God wants us to remember that consolation comes from Him, not from our efforts.
     - We don't control consolation or desolation.
     - We are simply branches that connect to the vine, and our nourishment come from the vine, not from ourselves.
     - We can attach pride even to spiritual experiences.
     - Removal of consolation helps us purify our love for God.
     - It reminds us to anchor our love of God in Him, not in His gifts.
- Anticipate rule 10.
  - God it training humility before consolation returns.
  - This helps us to receive consolation with clinging to it.
  - We can receive consolation with gratitude rather than entitlement.

**Scripture Annotations for Rule 9:**
📖 Cause 1 — Neglect or Tepidity

Revelation 2:4–5
> “You have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first.”
  - 🧭 God withdraws felt closeness to awaken attentiveness, not to punish.

📖 Cause 2 — Trial and Fidelity

Job 1:21
> “The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.”
  - 🧭 Faithfulness without consolation reveals purified love.

1 Peter 1:6–7
> “Though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials…”

📖 Cause 3 — Humility and Gift

1 Corinthians 4:7
> “What do you have that you did not receive?”
  - 🧭 Directly echoes Ignatius’s warning against pride in spiritual gifts.

John 15:5
> “Apart from me you can do nothing.”
  - 🧭 Supports your vine-and-branches insight perfectly.
