**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola: Week 1, Rule 11**
- Remember:
  - Desolation is **not** spiritual *losing*.
  - Consolation is **not** spiritual *winning*.

The text of Rule 11:
> Eleventh Rule (Spiritual Consolation and Spiritual Desolation: Finding Our Balance). The eleventh: let one who is consoled seek to humble himself and lower himself as much as he can, thinking of how little he is capable in the time of desolation without such grace or consolation. On the contrary, let one who is in desolation think that he can do much with God’s sufficient grace to resist all his enemies, taking strength in his Creator and Lord. (SE 324) 

The Eleventh rule reminds us to remain humble, because consolation is a gift from God, not based on our merits.
The Eleventh rule is about striking a balance between consolation and desolation.
The Eleventh rule is a time to recognize the grace God gives us in desolation to resist all activity of the enemy.
- In the previous time of desolation, God made available to us all the grace required to see us through it.
  - We may, or may not have faltered.  That is not the point.
  - We should learn from that time: good or bad.
  - Where, and how did we run to God to draw on His grace and strength.
  - Where, and how did we **NOT** run to God to draw on His grace and strength.
  - Reflect on how difficult you consider the last desolation.
    - Reflect on the fact that God made enough grace available to you to see you through it.
- This season of consolation is a time to renew our fidelity to God.
  - It is a time to strengthen our connection to the branch: the source, God, who sustains us.
  - It is a time to recognize our reliance on God's grace at all times.
    - We also need grace in time of consolation to see clearly our relationship with God.
- The enemy can tempt us in a time of consolation as well, by putting the thought in our mind that we can relax a little.
  - That would be akin to allowing a little separation from the branch that sustains us.
  - Or we could begin to think that *our* efforts were sufficient to see us through the last desolation,
    - and that we now have our reward.
- Humility before God is necessary in both consolation and desolation.
