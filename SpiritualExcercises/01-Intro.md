**The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola**
**Introduction**
St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556)
* Born into a noble Spanish family of military men.
* He wanted to be just like his Dad and older brothers: a knight.
* He was a typical noble military man in behavior and character.
  * brash and a bit arrogant because of his family's standing in society.
* He was wounded in a battle and laid up in hospital for a long time.
* Out of boredom, he begins to read the Bible and the lives of the saints.
* Eventually, the Gospel begins to influence how he thought about his life.
  * He begins to have a deep desire to draw near to God.
  * While still in hospital, he thinks deeply about how his emotions, desires, and temptations work on his heart and mind.
	* Some make him feel empty, restless, and increasingly pull him away from God.
    * Other thoughts, emotions, and desires draw him near to God.
  * Over time he develops the Spiritual Exercises
	* A series of structured mediations, prayers, and reflections
	* Designed to help lead a person to grow
	  * in spiritual freedom
	  * discernment of God's will
	  * deepen their relationship with Jesus Christ.
	* Originally a 30-day retreat.
	  * He realized not everyone can take of 30 straight days.
	    * develops adaptations.
		* the Exercises for Daily Life stretch the same spiritual journey over several months.
  * The Rules of Discernment are developed out of this broader work of the Exercises.
    * they offer a path for any Christian, in whatever state of life,
	  * to grow in awareness of God's presence,
	  * to seek God's will for any situation,
	  * especially to respond to God's leading with greater love and freedom.
	  * also to discern when evil is leading them astray
	    * and what to do about it: how to combat it.
    * These rules are great part of the heart of Ignatian Spirituality and its everyday application to daily life.
	  * Learning to *notice*, *understand*, and *respond* to God's voice
	  * amid the competing hills and valleys of *consolation* and *desolation* in daily life.
	    * we will be defining *consolation* and *desolation* soon.
