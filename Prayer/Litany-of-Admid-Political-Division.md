# A Litany Amid Political Division and Confusion

This came about due to my feelings of being overwhelmed by the state of the USA and rest of the world.  I had a conversation with ChatGPT, and the result was this litany.  At the bottom, I have reproduced some of the conversation, so you can see how it was developed.

# Litany for Truth, Conversion, and Perseverance

(Responses are suggested.)

## Preparatory Prayer (Carmelite in spirit)
### Leader:
Lord, strip my prayer of hatred disguised as clarity.
Purify my desire so that I want Your truth more than my vindication.
### Response:
God of truth, purify my heart.

## I. Freedom from False Consolation

From the consolation of being “the sane one,”
-  Deliver me, Lord.

From the consolation of moral superiority,
-  Deliver me, Lord.

From the consolation of righteous anger,
-  Deliver me, Lord.

From contempt that feels like clarity,
-  Deliver me, Lord.

From despair disguised as realism,
-  Deliver me, Lord.

## II. For Leaders — Conversion to Truth, Restraint from Evil

For all who govern, legislate, judge, and command,
that they may fear God more than power,
-  Holy Spirit, convert hearts and restrain evil.

Where leaders cling to falsehood, confront them with reality they cannot bend,
-  Holy Spirit, convert hearts and restrain evil.

Where ambition outweighs wisdom, reorder their loves,
-  Holy Spirit, convert hearts and restrain evil.

Where party loyalty replaces moral clarity, divide what must be divided,
-  Holy Spirit, convert hearts and restrain evil.

Give them counselors who speak truth without fear,
-  Holy Spirit, convert hearts and restrain evil.

## III. Against Violence — Without Denying Humanity

### God of the Exodus,
break the habits of violence that take root in institutions.
-  Jesus, Hear the cry of the oppressed.

Interrupt commands that train ordinary people to harm the vulnerable.
-  Jesus, Hear the cry of the oppressed.

Protect those at the mercy of force.
-  Jesus, Hear the cry of the oppressed.

Expose lies that justify cruelty.
-  Jesus, Hear the cry of the oppressed.

Unmask fear masquerading as law.
-  Jesus, Hear the cry of the oppressed.

Dismantle systems that reward dehumanization.
-  Jesus, Hear the cry of the oppressed.

And save the souls of those who are taught to call cruelty “duty.”
-  Father in Heaven, have mercy on them.

## IV. Against Dividing Spirits & Epistemic Darkness

Lord, reveal truth in ways no argument can.
-  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

Let what is built on falsehood fail under its own weight.
-  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

Return us to the real: the poor, the suffering, the consequences.
-  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

Preserve me from reciprocal madness.
-  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

Keep me from becoming what I oppose.
-  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

## V. Examen Petition (Closing)

Where I felt contempt today,
-  Heal me, God.

Where I reduced a person to a symbol,
-  Heal me, God.

Where I clung to being right instead of being truthful,
-  Heal me, God.

Where I refused despair,
-  I thank You, God.

For tomorrow’s grace: courage without hatred, clarity without cruelty, hope without illusion,
-  Please grant it, God.

## Final Prayer

Lord Jesus Christ,
You stood before lies without surrendering to them,
before violence without mirroring it,
before rejection without despair.

Do not let the chaos of the age hollow me out.
Anchor me in Your truth,
keep my love intact,
and make my fidelity quiet, deep, and unbreakable.

**Amen**

## This is what I asked ChatGPT:
> *slight paraphrase:* "My Christian faith does not align with the current American President and his administration's view of anything.  You know a lot about my Christian faith and its leaning toward orthodox theology, especially the more Carmelite and Ignatian expressions of spirituality.  How can I pray for our government leaders and, in particular, <insert politician's names here>, the divide between Democrats and Republicans, the divide in society, etc?  How can I pray for, or more accurately, against the violence ICE agents use against people?  Things seem to be getting more chaotic.  How does one pray for people who seem to think and feel exactly opposite from oneself, to the point that they think exactly opposite things about the same hard facts?"

## ChatGPT response: 
You’re asking a deeply Christian question, not a political one: how to remain faithful, truthful, and non-violent in heart and prayer when leaders, systems, and even neighbors seem radically opposed to reality as you see it. From an orthodox, especially Ignatian and Carmelite, standpoint, there is a way to pray here that neither collapses into rage nor into denial.

I’ll answer in four layers, moving from interior prayer → intercession → prayer “against” violence → prayer amid epistemic fracture (when people deny shared facts).

### 1. First principle (Ignatian): Never pray from disordered affect
Ignatius is blunt: when we pray from anger, contempt, or despair, we are not free, and our prayer subtly seeks self-justification rather than God’s will.
> “In time of desolation, never make a change.” (SpEx 318)

Before praying for them, pray to be freed from false consolation:
- the consolation of being “the sane one”
- the consolation of moral superiority
- the consolation of righteous anger

A short preparatory prayer (Carmelite in spirit):
> Lord, strip my prayer of hatred disguised as clarity.
Purify my desire so that I want Your truth more than my vindication.

Only then proceed.

### 2. How to pray for leaders you believe are gravely wrong
The Church does not ask you to pray that leaders succeed in unjust policies. She asks you to pray that they be converted to truth and restrained from evil.

This distinction matters.<br />
Biblical pattern:
- Jeremiah prays for Babylon’s king, not because Babylon is just, but because God’s sovereignty is real (Jer 29:7).
- Jesus prays for those who crucify Him, not affirming their worldview, but asking the Father to *interrupt their blindness* (Luke 23:34).

#### How to name specific leaders (Trump, Vance, Rubio, Johnson, etc.)
- Do not pray vaguely (“bless them”).
- Pray teleologically—toward God’s ends.
  - Example structure:
    > Lord of truth,
    where Donald Trump clings to falsehood, confront him with reality he cannot bend.
    Where JD Vance seeks power over wisdom, reorder his loves.
    Where Marco Rubio or Mike Johnson confuse party loyalty with moral clarity, divide what must be divided.
    Give them advisors who fear You more than access.

This is not hatred.<br />
This is biblical intercession (cf. Ps 141; 1 Tim 2:1–4).

### 3. How to pray against violence (including ICE abuses) without dehumanizing
Orthodox prayer never targets persons as enemies.<br />
It only spirits, structures, and sins.

#### Theologically precise framing
You pray:
- against cruelty
- against lies that justify cruelty
- against fear masquerading as law
- against systems that reward dehumanization
- But **never against** the humanity of the agent.

A prayer “against violence” that stays Orthodox
> God of the Exodus,
break the habits of violence that take root in institutions.
Interrupt commands that train ordinary people to harm the vulnerable.
Protect those at the mercy of force.
And save the souls of those who are taught to call cruelty ‘duty.’

This mirrors:
- Exodus 3 (God hears the cry of the oppressed)
- Matthew 25 (Christ hidden in the vulnerable)
- Romans 12 (evil overcome by good, not mirrored)

### 4. The hardest question you asked: How to pray when people deny shared reality
This is where Ignatian discernment is most needed.

#### Ignatius would say:
You are not dealing primarily with disagreement, but with different operative spirits.
> “The enemy acts like a false lover… wanting secrecy.” (SpEx 326)

#### How to pray here (very concrete)
- Pray for illumination, not persuasion
  > Lord, reveal truth in ways no argument can.
- Pray for the collapse of lies, not the humiliation of liars
  > Let what is built on falsehood fail under its own weight.
- Pray for shared contact with reality.  This is deeply Carmelite—truth as encounter.
  > Return us to the real: the poor, the suffering, the consequences.
- Pray to be preserved from reciprocal madness
  > Keep me from becoming what I oppose.
- This protects you from the subtle spiritual danger of the age:
  > thinking clarity alone makes one righteous.

### 5. A daily Ignatian Examen tailored to this moment (5 minutes)
Given your existing prayer discipline, this fits naturally:
- Where did I feel contempt today? (name it without defending it)
- Where did I reduce a person to a symbol?
- Where did I cling to “being right” instead of being truthful?
- Where did I refuse despair? (thank God for that grace)
- Ask for tomorrow’s grace: courage without hatred, clarity without cruelty

### 6. Final anchor (so chaos doesn’t hollow you)
The saints you are implicitly standing with—Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, Ignatius, all lived under corrupt, violent, dishonest regimes.

None of them believed:
- chaos meant God had lost control
- or that clarity required fury
- or that prayer meant withdrawal
They believed truth survives by depth, not volume.

> “Let nothing disturb you… God alone suffices.”
— Teresa of Ávila

## What I asked ChatGPT:
> "In the Litany, part II, you wrote, "Where party loyalty replaces moral clarity, divide what must be divided".
What do you mean by "divide what must be divided"?  One problem with our society and our culture is division, so I don't think your meaning is to add more division.  So please clarify your meaning in this sentence."

## ChatGPT's reponse:
That’s an important question—and you’re right to pause over the word divide, because not all division is the same in Christian theology. I did not mean social fragmentation, tribalism, or hardening camps. I meant something much older, much more biblical, and actually healing when rightly understood.

Let me clarify carefully.

### 1. What “divide what must be divided” does not mean
It does not mean:
- deepening partisan hostility
- encouraging schism for its own sake
- validating “us vs. them” thinking
- multiplying factions or echo chambers

That kind of division is explicitly condemned:
> “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste.” (Matt 12:25)

So your instinct is correct: that division is a sign of disorder.

### 2. What it does mean (biblically and Ignatianly)
#### A. Interior moral distinction, not social rupture
The phrase refers first to interior discernment, especially in leaders:
- separating truth from loyalty
- separating office from ego
- separating law from fear
- separating prudence from expediency

This is the kind of “division” Scripture praises:
> “The word of God is living and active…
dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow,
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.”
(Hebrews 4:12)

This division heals by clarifying.<br />
Ignatius would say: confusion persists when things that should be distinct are allowed to blur.

#### B. Judgment in the sense of krisis, not condemnation
The Greek krisis means decision or separation, not hatred.

Jesus Himself says:
> “For judgment (krisis) I came into this world,
that those who do not see may see.”
(John 9:39)

This “division” is revelatory, not punitive.<br />
It exposes:
- when “party” becomes an idol
- when unity is purchased at the price of truth
- when loyalty replaces conscience

#### C. Separating false unity from true communion
Much of our cultural division is actually the collapse of false unity.

False unity says:
- Don’t name evil or we’ll lose cohesion
- Don’t challenge lies or we’ll fracture
- Don’t dissent or you’re the problem

Christian unity is different:
- “Maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” (Eph 4:3)

That unity requires truth (Eph 4:15).
When truth is sacrificed to preserve appearances, division is merely postponed — and worsened.

So “divide what must be divided” means:
> Let false unity fail so real communion can emerge.

### 3. Ignatian grounding
Ignatius assumes that confusion is a strategy of the enemy.
- The enemy blends motives (“I’m doing this for the common good”)
- The good spirit distinguishes (“This part is love; this part is fear”)

This is why Ignatius insists on naming and separating movements of the soul.

Applied to leadership:
- party loyalty ≠ moral clarity
- consensus ≠ truth
- strength ≠ domination
Failing to divide these leads to moral collapse masquerading as unity.

### 4. Why this actually reduces destructive division
Paradoxically, when leaders:
- distinguish truth from tribe
- conscience from calculation
- authority from ego
they become less polarizing, not more.

Most toxic division arises when:
- people feel gaslit
- reality is denied
- moral distinctions are blurred

Clear distinctions lower the emotional temperature, even when disagreement remains.

### 5. A refined wording (if you prefer)
If the phrase still troubles you, here are faithful alternatives that preserve the meaning:
- “Distinguish what must not be confused”
- “Separate conscience from party loyalty”
- “Clarify where allegiance has replaced truth”
- “Unmask false unity so true communion may grow”

Or the liturgical version:
> Where party loyalty replaces moral clarity,
restore the courage to distinguish truth from tribe.

### 6. Why this matters for your deeper concern
You are not asking for more sides.<br />
You are asking for contact with reality.

The prayer is not:
- Make them agree with me.
It is:
- Make truth discernible again.

That kind of “division” is not the cause of chaos.<br />
It is the beginning of repentance.

## What I asked ChatGPT:
> "Take the adapted rules of discernment you wrote, rules A - G, and map them to the original Ignatian rules. I think each probably maps to multiple rules in the original. Also scripture and the Catechism if possible."

## ChatGPT's reponse:
Below is a theological mapping, not a one-to-one proof-text. Ignatius did not imagine propaganda ecosystems or epistemic collapse, but the inner logic of his Rules maps remarkably well. I’ll show:
- Which original Rules (SpEx 313–336) each adaptation draws from
- Why the mapping works (spiritual principle)
- Key Scripture
- Catechism anchors
- I’ll use Ignatius’ traditional numbering (First–Fourteenth Rules).

### Rule A — Truth never needs to dehumanize
When clarity produces contempt, pause.
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 1 (313): Direction of spirits differs by moral trajectory
  - Rule 2 (314): The good spirit gives peace, encouragement, love
  - Rule 5 (318): In desolation, do not change course
  - Rule 12 (325): The enemy acts aggressively when resisted
- Why this maps:
  - Ignatius assumes the good spirit always increases charity, even when convicting. Contempt is a reliable sign that something has slipped from illumination into accusation.
- Scripture
  - Eph 4:15 — “Speaking the truth in love”
  - James 3:17 — “Wisdom from above is… gentle, open to reason”
  - John 8:44–46 — Truth frees; lies enslave
- Catechism
  - CCC 1829 — Charity requires benevolence, not contempt
  - CCC 2478 — Avoid rash judgment about others’ intentions

### Rule B — False consolation flatters identity
“At least I see clearly.”
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 3 (316): True consolation draws toward God, not self
  - Rule 6 (319): Resist consolation rooted in pride
  - Rule 13 (326): The enemy wants secrecy and ego reinforcement
- Why this maps:
  - Ignatius is explicit: consolation that terminates in self-satisfaction rather than humility before God is suspect—even if it feels “right.”
- Scripture
  - Luke 18:9–14 — Pharisee vs. tax collector
  - 1 Cor 8:1 — “Knowledge puffs up, love builds up”
- Catechism
  - CCC 1866 — Pride as root sin
  - CCC 2094 — Idolatry includes self-exaltation

### Rule C — The good spirit draws toward reality, not abstraction
God works in incarnation.
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 2 (314): Consolation increases love for concrete goods
  - Rule 4 (317): Desolation pulls away from embodied charity
  - Rule 8 (321): Consolation leads toward what is real and sustaining
- Why this maps:
  - Ignatius presumes embodied discernment—actual prayer, actual service, actual people. Abstraction is fertile ground for deception.
- Scripture
  - John 1:14 — “The Word became flesh”
  - Matt 25:31–46 — Encountering Christ in the vulnerable
  - 1 John 4:20 — Love tested in the concrete
- Catechism
  - CCC 515 — Christ’s entire life is revelation
  - CCC 2447 — Corporal works of mercy ground truth

### Rule D — Desolation masquerades as realism
Cynicism feels sober but kills hope.
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 4 (317): Desolation brings darkness, agitation, despair
  - Rule 7 (320): Desolation permitted for humility, not resignation
  - Rule 9 (322): Causes of desolation include loss of hope
- Why this maps:
  - Ignatius distinguishes sobriety from despair. Realism that erodes hope is not lucidity; it is spiritual pressure.
- Scripture
  - Rom 5:5 — “Hope does not disappoint”
  - Rev 9:20–21 — Humanity’s refusal to repent (your insight)
  - 2 Cor 4:8–9 — Afflicted, but not crushed
- Catechism
  - CCC 2091 — Despair as sin against hope
  - CCC 1818 — Christian hope amid suffering

### Rule E — Do not argue with lies; outlast them
Truth is discerned by fruits over time.
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 5 (318): Do not react in desolation
  - Rule 10 (323): Store up strength from past consolation
  - Rule 14 (327): Anticipate the enemy’s future tactics
- Why this maps:
  - Ignatius favors spiritual endurance over reactive engagement. Constant rebuttal is often cooperation with distraction.
- Scripture
  - Matt 7:16 — “By their fruits you shall know them”
  - Isa 30:15 — “In quietness and trust shall be your strength”
- Catechism
  - CCC 2727 — Perseverance amid distraction
  - CCC 1788 — Moral discernment requires time and fruit

### Rule F — In chaos, narrow the fidelity
Depth over breadth.
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 6 (319): Intensify prayer, not analysis
  - Rule 8 (321): Consolation strengthens for future trials
  - Rule 11 (324): Humility tempers overreaction
- Why this maps:
  - When overwhelmed, Ignatius does not advise expanding commitments—but deepening essentials.
- Scripture
  - Luke 10:41–42 — “One thing is necessary”
  - Heb 12:1–2 — Fix your eyes on Christ
- Catechism
  - CCC 2707–2708 — Simplicity in prayer
  - CCC 2015 — Way of perfection passes through the cross

### Rule G — Never consent to becoming what you oppose
The enemy’s final victory is mirroring.
- Ignatian sources
  - Rule 12 (325): Resist firmly or be overwhelmed
  - Rule 13 (326): The enemy thrives in secrecy and imitation
  - Rule 14 (327): Discern trajectory, not moment
- Why this maps:
  - Ignatius warns that the enemy’s most subtle work is corruption of character, not error of opinion.
- Scripture
  - Rom 12:17–21 — “Do not be overcome by evil”
  - Matt 5:44 — Love enemies
  - Gal 5:22–23 — Fruits of the Spirit as test
- Catechism
  - CCC 2843–2845 — Refusing to mirror evil
  - CCC 1809 — Fortitude preserves moral integrity

### Synthesis (the through-line)

Ignatius’ Rules assume:
- Truth without charity is unstable
- Consolation must enlarge God, not ego
- Despair is never neutral
- Time reveals spirits
- Holiness is fidelity under pressure

Your adaptations are faithful developments, not distortions.<br />
They translate Ignatius from personal temptation to civilizational temptation — which Revelation itself recognizes.
