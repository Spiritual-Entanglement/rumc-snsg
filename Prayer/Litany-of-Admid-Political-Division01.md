## Litany for Truth, Conversion, and Perseverance

**Preparatory Prayer** (Carmelite in spirit)
Lord, strip my prayer of hatred disguised as clarity.
Purify my desire so that I want Your truth more than my vindication.

God of truth, purify my heart.

## IV. Against Dividing Spirits & Epistemic Darkness
- Lord, reveal truth in ways no argument can.
  -  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

  -  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.
- Return us to the Gospel: the poor, the suffering, the consequences.
  -  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.
- Preserve us from reciprocal madness.
  -  Father Almighty, Lead us into Your light.

## V. Examen Petition (Closing)

  -  Heal me, God.
- Where I reduced a person to a symbol,
  -  Heal me, God.
- Where I clung to being right instead of being truthful,
  -  Heal me, God.
- Where I refused despair,
  -  I thank You, God.
- For tomorrow’s grace: courage without hatred, clarity without cruelty, hope without illusion,
  -  Please grant it, God.

## Final Prayer

Lord Jesus Christ,
You stood before lies without surrendering to them,
before violence without mirroring it,
before rejection without despair.

Do not let the chaos of the age hollow me out.
Anchor me in Your truth,
keep my love intact,
and make my fidelity quiet, deep, and unbreakable.

**Amen**
